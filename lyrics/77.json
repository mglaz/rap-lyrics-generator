        "\nUh, with everything happening today\nYou don't know whether you're coming or going, but\nYou think that you're on your way\nLife lined up on the mirror, don't blow it\n\n\nWoah, look at me when I'm talking to you\nYou looking at me but I'm looking through you\nI see the blood in your eyes\nI see the love in disguise\nI see the pain hidden in your pride\nI see you're not satisfied\nAnd I don't see nobody else\nI see myself, I'm looking at the..\n\n\nMirror on the wall (Woah)\nHere we are again (Yeah)\nThrough my rise and fall (Uh)\nYou've been my only friend (Yeah)\nYou told me that they can\nUnderstand the man I am\nSo why are we here\nTalking to each other again?\n\n\nUh, I see the truth in your lies\nI see nobody by your side\nBut I'm with you when you're all alone\nAnd you correct me when I'm looking wrong\nI see the guilt beneath the shame\nI see your soul through your window pane\nI see the scars that remain\nI see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the..\n\n\nMirror on the wall\nHere we are again (Yeah)\nThrough my rise and fall (Uh-huh)\nYou've been my only friend (My only friend)\nYou told me that they can\nUnderstand the man I am (They can't understand)\nSo why are we here (Misunderstood)\nTalking to each other again? (Woah)\n\n\nLooking at me now I can see my past\nDamn, I look just like my fucking dad\nLight it up, that's smoke and mirrors\nI even look good in a broken mirror\nI see my mama smile, that's a blessing\nI see the change, I see the message\nAnd no message coulda been any clearer\nSo I'm starting with the man in the...\n\n\nMirror on the wall (MJ taught me that)\nHere we are again\nThrough my rise and fall (Uh)\nYou've been my only friend (Take 'em to Mars, man)\nYou told me that they can\nUnderstand the man I am\nSo why are we\nTalking to each other again? (Uh)\nMirror on the wall (Woah)\nHere we are again (Yeah)\nThrough my rise and fall\nYou've been my only friend (Any questions?)\nYou told me that they can (I come to you)\nUnderstand the man I am (You always have the answer)\nSo why are we here\nTalking to each other again?\n\n\nMirror on the wall\nHey B.P, looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time\nSo why are we\nTalking to each other again?"

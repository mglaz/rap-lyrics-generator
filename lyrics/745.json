        "Part 1: You Should Know\n\n\nI'm a, a, a rolling stone (oh, oh)\nAnd, and, and I keep on turning (oh, oh)\nBut you keep trying to hold on (oh, oh)\nMa-ma-maybe you should learn\nYou should know better\nYou should know better\nYou should know better\nYou should know better\nYou should know better\n\n\nPapa just copped a Mustang\nLookin' at you like it must sting\nSweatin' me and mine, I bet a dollar your nuts stank\nHoppin' on the left coast learnin' new west slang\nNaturally better, versus them, it's like flint to a cup of rain bars\nI'm on par with Rocky and Clubber Lang posse\nKnow I'm possibly the best they ever seen\nYeah, I'm possibly the best you ever seen\nYoung Gu yellin' I should rippity rap more\nI'm known to black out, y'all resemble the Oscars\nFlow so much I need life guards\nNot like Rikers, them some whole new bars\nInfluenced by many but I'm a whole new star, yeah\nThere's levels to this but I'm a whole new floor\nThey talkin' keys to success but I'm a whole new door\nStill slippin' through traffic screamin' \nI'm breakin' the law, was too much to ever ignore\nI been exceedin' the limit since I had an Accord\nAlways had a need for speed before I met that boy\n9th Wonder, I spent the summer bumpin' Wuuuu, nigga (Wuuu, nigga)\nNow they like, \"Wooo, nigga!\" (wooo, nigga)\nBeen hearin' you for a few, nigga (for a few, nigga)\nIt's true too many can't fuck with ya\nUh, hope you know the realness in that bar\nI know some rappers only nice to me as jesters\nWho really just afraid 'cause they know I go that hard\nAskin' if so-and-so and I are gon' rap together, yeah\nDon't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried about it\nThere's room in this game, it ain't crowded\nAimin' at the top nowadays, y'all worried 'bout Miley Cyrus\nThat's a tear in my eye that I ain't cried\nIt's some paths to a milli homie, you ain't tried\nI count ten by fives, I'm always halfway there in my mind\nIt's on you to catch up this time\n'Cause you know\n\n\nI'm a, a, a rolling stone (oh, oh)\nAnd, and, and I keep on turning (oh, oh)\nBut you keep trying to hold on (oh, oh)\nMa-ma-maybe you should learn\nYou should know better\nYou should know better\nYou should know better\nYou should know better\nYou should know better\n\n\nDropped out of poo-poo weighin' 6-2 with a loose screw\nThat the doctor couldn't glue, ooh look mama, she said\nThis world a game, you crack with two commas\nWhen Tutankhamun was Africana, you were a black diamond\nKnow too many stars turn to comets\nWe run from the comics until we subjects to the comics\nI'm a hero, don't be stressin' the zeroes and the commas\nLookin' anacondas, know they comin' with apples and oranges Satan playin' me, I ain't Adam unless we talkin' 'bout bombin'\nOver Baghdad, you look bad tryna to spar with me\nI'm a lethal weapon, a saber or a razor, Darth Vader, Al Qaeda\nEvery friend of Jada, that set it off, I'm a midget at labor\nDeliverin' babies the size of raiders, opinions were made\nUltimatums got none so don't come lookin' for favors\nI'm tired of you fakers, Carolina, but I still rep the Lakers\nWestside, Eastside, every side my tithes good with my neighbors\nDouble back on my sins and pray one day I'm good with my maker\nTomato, tomato don't apply, you better watch what you say to me\nEverythin' ain't okay to me, everybody won't cater me\nThough I know I'm a child of destiny, fulfillment is up to me\nUp to your neck in debt for every bet you threw up against me\nLord listen, forgive me, I ain't got no sympathy flowers\nThey say it's better to die with pride than to die as a coward\nI say some situations call for our pride to be swallowed\nSo we live to watch payback come in the form of good karma\n'Cause you know\n\n\nI'm a, a, a rolling stone (oh, oh)\nAnd, and, and I keep on turning (oh, oh)\nBut you keep trying to hold on (oh, oh)\nMa-ma-maybe you should learn\nYou should know better\nYou should know better\nYou should know better\nYou should know better\nYou should know better\n\nPart 2: Bustalude\n\n\nYeah\nYou know I heard what he said right?\nLoving you was all I wanna do\nMy whole life\nRapsody\nPlease let your brother Busta Rhymes elaborate on this topic a little further\nYou know the subject of love\nLet me get on my Barry White shit real quick\n\n\nRoyal empress queen, damn, I so adore you\nThere's so many ways to describe this love I've been holdin' for you\nI been lookin' for this forever, been searchin' abroad\nFor that original woman lovin', the nurture to God\nThe power of your presence speaks even when bein' silent\nUniversal alignment, I respect your refinement\nThe focus to blossom this love is my only assignment\nI wanna provide and take care of you until we approachin' timing\nAnd when you talk, your words remind me of beautiful speeches\nSay to myself, I thank God for these beautiful creatures\nUsually deep will be the feelin' every day we meet up\nAfter we fuck, I'ma face you and kick my feet up\nThe way you hot inside is such a beautiful reminder\nThe type to make me comfortable puttin' my seed inside her\nYou're such a rider, love how you're such a fighter\nAnd I wish that I could find a way to multiply her\nI'll give it to her gentle, then I emulsify her\nAnd when she asks to have it, I smash it and then we both retire\nPut your hand up in the air, girl\nLet me shine my light up on you earth while you in here, girl\nDamn, you got me swingin', girl\nWhat makes it hotter is mami and God's fan, girl\nYeah baby, you special, you're one of one\nIf the decision's up to us, we ain't never done\nLet's get back to the fun"

He just ran away\n'Cause he's a runaway...\n\nWhy'd you have to make a record bout me?\nThe R-r-r-r-rrrrrr R-O-X-A-N-N-E\n\nWhy'd you have to make a record 'bout me?\nWhy why why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?\nWhy why why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?\nWhy why why'd you have to\nWhy why why'd you have to make a record 'bout me?\n\nThe R-r-r-r-rrrrrr R-O-X-A-N-N-E\n\nR-r-r-r-rrrrrr R-O-X-A-N-N-E"

        "\nI rise as day breaks\nClouds hide the sun\u2019s rays\nQuick sand and mistakes\nSmash walls to get through\nI fight the good fight\nEven on the bad days\nIt\u2019s darkest before light\nI\u2019m gonna push through\n\n\nTurbo-charged bars\nSlot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars\nAin\u2019t nothing band-aids won\u2019t cover\nTouring with 7D coverage\nLive bands, two buses, my own cash\nNo budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby\nWe went from crawling to walking to running\nYou can\u2019t say nothing, you under gag order\nHopping out of Audi\u2019s hurting y\u2019all with kicks, I\u2019m the Transporter\nThink about it, never mind, you ain\u2019t gotta\nI\u2019m already on some whole other, word to yo mufuckin' self\nNobody else gon\u2019 do it for ya, nobody else\nEvery now and then someone\u2019ll offer ya help, but they ain\u2019t doing nothing\n'Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain\u2019t bluffing\nKush puffing on you jive turkeys\nStuffing stockings with these gifts\nAudible applaudables homie take a wiff\n\n\nI rise as day breaks\nClouds hide the sun\u2019s rays\nQuick sand and mistakes\nSmash walls to get through\nI fight the good fight\nEven on the bad days\nIt\u2019s darkest before light\nI\u2019m gonna push through\n\n\nWhen you a man, action is what\u2019s expected, nothing is spoken on\nProducer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond\nMy flow is tom-foolery\nI smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie\nI beautifully exude the vibe that\u2019s free of ambiguity\nYa goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me\nIt\u2019s coonery, it\u2019s lunacy, let\u2019s make it plain\nOnly way that you hang is attached to a tree\nThe moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently\nShe makes it rain\nWhen I\u2019m on fire, she always try to douse me\nOnly reason that you make it rain is \u2018cause your diamonds cloudy\nI see you from a mile away when it get overcast\nOld people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass\nAnd let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia\nSpread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement\nThe score to your achievements, never join \u2018em so you gotta beat \u2018em\nIt\u2019s carpe diem hey (hey) yeah\n\n\nI rise as day breaks\nClouds hide the sun\u2019s rays\nQuick sand and mistakes\nSmash walls to get through\nI fight the good fight\nEven on the bad days\nIt\u2019s darkest before light\nI\u2019m gonna push through\n\n\nLike kindergarteners\nMy vision\u2019s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners\nTry your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya\nThe starving\u2019ll speed on ya, stampede on ya\nImpede on your pockets then pee on ya\nDreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens\nSpending, established, with women dining and laughing\nBut this environment got us violent, ready to crash in\u2013\n\u2013to society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened\nYour seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped\nSo many times I can build casinos from scratch\nToo many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax\nThat\u2019s what my mental say, but my physical\u2019s been detached\nI\u2019m on some other shit, like fuck the government\nI'm higher rankings, where\u2019s the mothership?\nI made a covenant that I was changing but my luck has been\nQuite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?\nLeft him face down like he was planking\nIn a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive\nYou can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting\nGot a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?\nRegardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga\nI'm focused\n\n\nI rise as day breaks\nClouds hide the sun\u2019s rays\nQuick sand and mistakes\nSmash walls to get through\nI fight the good fight\nEven on the bad days\nIt\u2019s darkest before light\nI\u2019m gonna push through"

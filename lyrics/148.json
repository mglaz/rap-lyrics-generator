        "\nMy regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send\nAnd I got neighbors, they're more like strangers\nWe could be friends\nI just need a way out of my head\nI'll do anything for a way out\nOf my head\n\n\nIn my own way, this feel like living\nSome alternate reality\nAnd I was drowning, but now I'm swimming\nThrough stressful waters to relief\nYeah, oh, the things I'd do\nTo spend a little time in Hell\nAnd what I won't tell you\nI'll prolly never even tell myself\n\n\nAnd don't you know that sunshine don't feel right\nWhen you inside all day\nI wish it was nice out, but it look like rain\nGrey skies are drifting, not living forever\nThey told me it only gets better\n\n\nMy regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send\nAnd I got neighbors, they're more like strangers\nWe could be friends\nI just need a way out of my head\nI'll do anything for a way out\nOf my head"

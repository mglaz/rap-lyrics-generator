        "\nOlualuweaway\nUweaway\nNo the chief don't run\nThe chief don't\nNo the chief don't run\n\n\nOh the chief don't run\nOh the chief don't run\nOh the chief don't run\nOh the chief don't run\n\n\nBefore the red cups and the backwoods smoke\nMe and mom in the shack in the woods, bro\nI was sleepin' on the floor with the oven door open\nWhile I dreamt about the places that I would go\nWe would go door to door to door all day\nWe were begging 'em to lay up in the foyer\nI was sittin' with the hookers in a motel hallway\nWaiting onna blind audition like it's Broadway\nNow these Madams looking like a fleet of foxes\nRat Pack chief of staff like Sinatra\nEat, drink, swank, nigga that's the mantra\nBetta stand when I speak, nigga, fix your posture\nChief don't run, baby, word to poppa\nWanted me to-be-a lawyer, engineer or doctor\nThe new Godfather, keep your old mobsters\nMatter fact, you can keep your old Oscars\nIt's tomorrow never dies now\nI'm on yacht with a prince in Dubai now\nI'm with the Dalai Lama's homies in the sky lounge\nCocktails got me loosenin' my tie now\nThey say a prophet never honored in his homeland\nThat's fine, I'd rather have my own land\nGotta plan for a hundred Roman numerals\nLong live the chief, nigga, welcome to your funeral\n\n\nOh the chief don't run\nOh the chief don't run\nOh the chief don't run\nOh the chief don't run\n\n\nIt's my time, hit the gong out here\nThey gon' need to build a bigger wall out here\nI live a different set of laws out here\nKnow my rights even when I'm in the wrong out here\nLook what we did with one song out here\nLike a locksmith opened every door out here\nYa dealing with a king, not a kong out here\nYou a pawn, but we can get along out here\nYou in my house actin' too free though\nWe know you foul\u2014nigga, two free throws\nChiefy, chiefy in a new chief cloak\nI ain't even said a word, but my suit bespoke\nI got a new agenda that gotta carry through\nWhen your father's enemies are tryna bury you\nAnd the royal families are tryna marry you\nLong live the chief, nigga\nWelcome to your burial\n\n\nOh the chief don't run\nOh the chief don't run\nOh the chief don't run\nOh the chief don't run\n\n\nEverybody wanna run, they don't want it like us\nPaid my dues, but they still tryna Wesley Snipe-us\nTell me why we gon' still win tonight\nBreakin' bread, we got everybody right"

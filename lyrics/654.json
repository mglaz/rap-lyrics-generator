        "\nYou bring the light\nTo my darkest side, babe\nThe day, the night\nSplit to cure the sight, oh\n\n\nYou care\nYou animate\nYou got me bare\nBring up the heart rate\n\n\nYour love\nRevives my soul\nAnd I know\nYou'll choose it whole\nOverall\n\n\nYour eyes are the mirror\nLook under the cover\nLove is above all\n\n\nI\u2019m safe\nInto your hands\nLet\u2019s move away\nThe edges expand\n\n\nYour love\nRevives my soul\nAnd I know\nYou'll choose it whole\nOverall\n\n\nShow me the source of the light\nI\u2019m becoming affected\nSeeing the glow of the way\nIs what I have detected\nFeeling again I\u2019m alive\nIt\u2019s a shiny reflected\nLove injected, love injected\n\n\nYour love\nRevives my soul\nAnd I know\nYou'll choose it whole\nOverall\n\nYour love\nRevives my soul\nAnd I know\nYou'll choose it whole\nOverall\n\n\nOhhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh\nOhhh, ohhh, ohh, oh oh, ohhh\nOhhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh\nOhhh, ohhh, ohh, oh oh, ohhhh"

        "\nLove ain't just black and white\nAin't that simple\nIt gets hard to tell who's wrong or right\nWhen It's dark with us\nI swear I barely see the light\nShould I stick it out?\nAre you worth this fight?\nAre we worth this fight?\nCuz I ain't no quitter babe\nAnd I be damned if all these years I let you diss me, babe\nI was there when no one wanted to stay with you baby\nYou know I deserve more than this\nI do\n\n\nSo tell me who\nWho's gonna love\nYou like I do\nWho will you trust\nI gave you too much\nEnough is enough\nNow we\u2019re in the thick of it\nSo tell me\nWho's gonna love\nYou like I do\nWho will you trust\nI gave you too much\nEnough is enough\nNow we're in the...\nNow we\u2019re in the thick of it\n\n\nWhat a hell of a year\nIf I make it through hell and I come out alive I got nothing to fear\nNo more crying and trying\nAnd bring back this loving when nothing is here\nLet me be clear\nI wasn\u2019t perfect\nBut this shit ain't worth it\nI\u2019m done with the mess\nI confess on the stress\nAnd I know Ima look back and call it a blessing\nCuz I ain't no quitter babe\nBut I be damned if all these years I let you diss me, babe\nI was there when no one wanted to stay with you baby\nYou know I deserve more than this\nI do\n\n\nSo tell me who\nWho's gonna love\nYou like I do\nWho will you trust\nI gave you too much\nEnough is enough\nNow we\u2019re in the thick of it\nSo tell me who\nWho's gonna love\nYou like I do\nWho will you trust\nI gave you too much\nEnough is enough\nNow we\u2019re in the\nWe\u2019re in the thick of it\n\n\nBoy you had someone who really loved you\n(boy you had someone who really loved you)\nShould have held on held on real tight now\n(held on tight)\nAnd she placed no other one above you\n(and she placed no one above you)\nBut you didn\u2019t want to treat her right now\nShould\u2019ve let her go\nShould\u2019ve let her go\nOh no oh, oh no oh\nNow I\u2019m letting go\nNow I\u2019m letting go\nOh no oh, oh no oh\n\n\nSo tell me who\nWho's gonna love\nYou like I do\nWho will you trust\nI gave you too much\nEnough is enough\nNow we\u2019re in the thick of it\nSo tell me who\nWho's gonna love\nYou like I do\nWho will you trust\nI gave you too much\nEnough is enough\nNow we\u2019re in the\nWe\u2019re in the thick of it"

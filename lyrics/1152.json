        "\nLet's get it!\n\n\nShe just wanna smoke all my weed\nAnd she just wanna sip all my lean\nAnd she just wanna spend all my cheese\nSo I told that ho to get on her knees\nShe just wanna smoke all my weed\nAnd she just wanna sip all my lean\nAnd she just wanna spend all my cheese\nBut she won't get a damn thing from me\n\n\nI be ballin' out, I got hella bands\nShows across the country, I got hella fans\nBlow it all on foreign cars and designer pants\nSo now these hoes hit my line sayin' I'm the man\nOvernight fame, I took off like a rocket\nStores send me free clothes askin' me to rock it\nNow I got all these bad hoes and they tryna pop it\nBut if she ain't sendin' nudes then I'm finna' block it\nSay she wanna come through and get high with me\nBitch, I got loud and I got the lean\nI just copped a QP, of that sour D\nPour up a 20 ounce of Sprite with that promethizine\nShawty think she getting cuffed but I just wanna fuck\nAnd I let her hang around cause she can roll a blunt\nShe done stayed at the crib, couple, more than once\nAsking \"Where your daughter at?\" I got her off the drugs\n\n\nShe just wanna smoke all my weed\nAnd she just wanna sip all my lean\nAnd she just wanna spend all my cheese\nSo I told that ho to get on her knees\nShe just wanna smoke all my weed\nAnd she just wanna sip all my lean\nAnd she just wanna spend all my cheese\nBut she won't get a damn thing from me\n\n\nYour girlfriend took her panties off at my show\nSaid if I wanna smash just let her know\nShe just wanna hang around and smoke my dope\nTold her get in line, with them other hoes\nI got hella guap now, never lookin' bummy\nGot my clout up, now all these bitches love me\nBut they just want my fame and my fuckin' money\nThat's why I just want some top, can't go like no dummy\nI just copped a Benz, pulling hoes so simple\nShe can ride with me if she givin' dental\nHer mans talkin' shit, sayin' it's a rental\nSo I fucked her in the back seat, wasn't gentle\nUsed to bum rides now I whip a foreign\nThat's why your girl hit my line, say you borin'\nShe say she wanna come with me when I'm tourin'\nTold that ho delete my number, quit callin'\n\n\nShe just wanna smoke all my weed\nAnd she just wanna sip all my lean\nAnd she just wanna spend all my cheese\nSo I told that ho to get on her knees\nShe just wanna smoke all my weed\nAnd she just wanna sip all my lean\nAnd she just wanna spend all my cheese\nBut she won't get a damn thing from me"

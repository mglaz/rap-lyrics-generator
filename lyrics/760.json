        "\nAyy, ayy\n\n\nI ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho\nI ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros\nAin't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole\nNiggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose\nLong nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio\nNow I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe\nLook into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow\nBust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo\n\n\nShawty wanna fuck me 'cause a nigga wearin' gold\nI came up and made it happen, I was trappin' by the store\nBig dope inside this Backwood case this nigga want smoke\nDo me dirty, I'ma find you, lay your ass out on the floor\n19 with a bag, I got rich by myself\nRather do this shit alone, I wasn't askin' for no help\nThey keep askin' how I'm winnin' with the cards that I was dealt\nBoy, I worked hard for this seat and I ain't bucklin' my belt\nCall my brother on the phone, he said, \"Broski, you a star\"\nI said, \"Brother, hold it down soon we'll all be livin' large\"\nAnd it's crazy how last year was sellin' coke out my garage\nNow I'm in a good position for this life, can't sabotage\n\n\nI ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho\nI ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros\nAin't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole\nNiggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose\nLong nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio\nNow I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe\nLook into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow\nBust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo\n\n\nI got tattoos on my face, I use that shit as motivation\nI could never get a job, so for my dream, I'm dedicated\nFor a second lost myself, I was too busy gettin' faded\nNow they see me out in public and be knowin' what my name is\nAll these rappers want the clout and the life of bein' famous\nI just wanna be stable, tell my family we made it\nI was comin' for my spot, a young nigga had to be patient\nNow I'm runnin' up these bands, can hit the island for vacation\nI've been shittin' on my haters, you could say I'm constipated\nFive racks on this fit just to stunt while I'm in Vegas\nGnarcotic on my body, shout out to my nigga Caleb\nYoung niggas got the cake up, now these bitches wanna date us\n\n\nI ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho\nI ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros\nAin't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole\nNiggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose\nLong nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio\nNow I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe\nLook into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow\nBust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo"

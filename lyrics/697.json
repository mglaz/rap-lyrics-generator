        "\nYo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets?\nWhy is the industry designed to keep the artist in debt?\nAnd why them dudes ain't ridin' if they part of your set?\nAnd why they never get it poppin' but they party to death?\nYeah, and why they gonna give you life for a murder?\nTurn around, only give you eight months for a burner?\nIt's goin' down; why they sellin' niggas' CD's for under a dime?\nAnd if it's all love, daddy, why you come with your 9?\nWhy my niggas ain't get that cake?\nWhy is a brother up north better than Jordan\nThat ain't get that break?\nWhy you don't stack instead of tryin' to be fly?\nWhy is rattin' at an all time high? Why are you even alive?\nWhy they kill 2Pac and Chris?\nWhy at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin' Cris?\nWhy them bullets have to hit that door?\nWhy did Kobe have to hit that raw? Why'd he kiss that whore?\nWhy?!\n\n\nAll that I\u2019ve been given\nIt's this pain that I\u2019ve been livin'\nThey got me in the system\nWhy they gotta do me like that?\nTried to make it my way\nBut got sent up on the highway\nWhy? Oh why?\nWhy they gotta do me like that?\n\n\nWhy do niggas push pounds and powder?\nWhy did Bush knock down the towers?\nWhy you around them cowards?\nWhy Aaliyah have to take that flight?\nWhy my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari?\nWhy he take that bike?\nWhy they gotta open your package and read your mail?\nWhy they stop lettin' niggas get degrees in jail?\nWhy you gotta do 85% of your time?\nAnd why do niggas lie in 85% of they rhymes?\nWhy a nigga always want what he can't have?\nWhy I can't come through in the pecan Jag?\nWhy did crack have to hit so hard?\nEven though it's almost over, why niggas can't get no jobs?\nWhy they come up with the witness protection?\nWhy they let the Terminator win the election?\nCome on, pay attention!\nWhy I sell in the stores what you could sell in the streets?\nWhy I say the hottest shit but be sellin' the least? why\n\n\nAll that I\u2019ve been given\nIt's this pain that I\u2019ve been livin'\nThey got me in the system\nWhy they gotta do me like that?\nTried to make it my way\nBut got sent up on the highway\nWhy? Oh why?\nWhy they gotta do me like that?\n\n\nWhy Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar?\nWhy Denzel have to be crooked before he took it?\nWhy they didn't make the CL6 with a clutch?\nAnd if you don't smoke\nThen why the hell you reachin' for my dutch?!\nWhy rap? \u2018Cause I need air time\nWhy be on the curb with a \"Why lie? I need a beer\" sign?\nWhy all the young niggas is dyin'?\n\u2018Cause they moms at work\nThey pops is gone, they livin' with iron\nWhy they ain't give us a cure for AIDS?\nWhy my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days?\nWhy you screamin' like it's a slug? It's only the hawk\nWhy my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York?\nWhy they forcin' you to be hard?\nWhy ain't you a thug by choice?\nWhy the whole world love my voice?\nWhy? Try to tell 'em that it's the flow, son\nAnd you know why they made the new twenties?\n\u2018Cause I got all the old ones \u2014 that's why!\n\n\nAll that I\u2019ve been given\nIs this pain that I\u2019ve been livin'\nThey got me in the system\nWhy they gotta do me like that?\nTried to make it my way\nBut got sent up on the highway\nWhy? Oh why?\nWhy they gotta do me like that?"

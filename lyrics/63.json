        "You\u2019ve been away from the spotlight a little bit. Was that a conscious decision?\nYeah. I needed time to master my craft. You don\u2019t rush art, and I don\u2019t think you quickly produce fine art. You take your time. That\u2019s not an excuse, or me trying to justify , that\u2019s truly what I believe. I took time off and learned how to act, learned how to make beats and do production\n\nHow has the making of the music changed, then?\nThis is more free than I\u2019ve ever been. I\u2019ve never been this free making music, ever. I\u2019m experimenting, listening, and looking for different sounds\n\nLooking back at Long Live A$AP, are there any regrets?\nYeah. I\u2019ve got that clich\u00e9 thing where I hate my biggest songs\n\nI remember Yams saying he didn\u2019t like \u201cWild for the Night.\u201d Would you ever make another song like that?\nThere\u2019s no need to\n\nNo? What other flaws did you see in the last album?\nThat album was rushed\n\nBy whom?\nMe\n\nWhy?\nI felt like I had to prove certain things that don\u2019t matter.  I was capable of hit singles and platinum records. That\u2019s not what I was ever after. That\u2019s something that you just hope for\n\nIn the three years since we last spoke, what has changed most about you?\nI\u2019ve matured. I\u2019m 26. I view life way different.  A little more different. And I don\u2019t give a fuck, still\n\nHow do you view life differently?\nI don\u2019t take people for granted no more. Nobody\u2019s promised tomorrow. I cherish everybody while they\u2019re here right now\n\nIs that something that you didn\u2019t do before?\nSometimes. I was oblivious. I did that by default. I was always away and getting caught up in my own life\n\nOne of the new songs starts out: \u201cGentrification split the nation I was raised in.\u201d It\u2019s one of the more politically conscious things you\u2019ve written. What do you see when you look at the state of America right now?\nIt\u2019s fucked up. That\u2019s all it is. Cops killing people, people killing cops. It\u2019s all fucked up. I think it\u2019ll all change soon. I think people with a badge\u2014or not\u2014are gonna stop abusing authority across the world, and learn to appreciate one another. For real.  All they need is weed, some love, some good sex, some good-ass music. I\u2019m talking about a night with something exotic. I\u2019m talking a night with like an African-Moroccan-half-Swedish-quarter-Italian-part-French-Parisian. Mhmm. But she got the African booty, though! She got caramel skin, but you can tell that like, she got a little bit of vanilla in her, though. You feel me? \n\nSure. So it\u2019s safe to say that women still inspire you?\nI\u2019m passionate about women. I look for ways to manifest that into my music. If they don\u2019t get the message, then I\u2019ll make something special for them. The message will get through one way or another. I love women. And I love the bitches\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference?\nThere\u2019s a difference\n\nWhat is it?\nI\u2019m not saying one\u2019s worse than the other, but \u201cwomen\u201d got they shit together. \u201cBitches\u201d is just out here, all burnt out with they heads cut off. Chickenheads. But somebody gotta love these hoes\n\nAre you single now?\nNo comment\n\nOK, let\u2019s go back to an old relationship: How do you feel about the criticism of Iggy Azalea for not being an \u201cauthentic\u201d rapper?\nThat  is unfortunate because nobody wants to be portrayed that way. I\u2019m quite sure she doesn\u2019t. I think she works hard like the rest of us. Silly or not, 300 million people like to watch it on YouTube, so who the fuck are we to say anything?\n\nSo you don\u2019t think the criticism is fair?\nIt comes with the game. If she fake on something, somebody is going to call her bluff. That\u2019s life. I\u2019m not looking at it from a standpoint of \u201cI used to be boning this chick\u2019s back out.\u201d I\u2019m looking at it  \u201cShe\u2019s just a person.\u201d You can\u2019t bluff. You gotta just be 100. That\u2019s all I could really say. The question is: Was she not being 100 about something?\n\nPeople feel like she\u2019s manufactured\nShe\u2019ll be fine. It gets to a point where people start accepting so much mediocre shit\u2014accepting the minimum and the typical\u2014to the point where everything gets so oversaturated that people don\u2019t have a choice but to go back to the original, hardcore, raw . Everything raw. Every aspect of art. It changes and it makes shifts\n\nSpeaking of changes, the Been Trill/Hood By Air diss in \u201cMultiply\u201d really made noise. What was behind that?\nIt\u2019s really nothing\n\nA lot of people cared\nNo one cares\n\nYou know that\u2019s not true\nI don\u2019t even think it\u2019s worth talking about.  just didn\u2019t acknowledge or respect my shit. I feel like I started all that and niggas didn\u2019t even acknowledge my shit. Or respect my shit\n\nHow did they not respect you?\nThe people behind the brands didn\u2019t acknowledge me as a pioneer because I didn\u2019t sit down and create the name Hood by Air with Shayne . I\u2019m taking full credit for that brand, for anyone knowing anything. Yes. I\u2019m taking credit for that. I liked it when I was way younger. It had a little run here and there, but nobody ever really kicked it off. I knew Shayne on a personal note. I was like: \u201cYo, let\u2019s bring this shit back.\u201d It took me years. Shayne\u2019s stubborn. He\u2019d give me a sweater one year, a T-shirt one year. It was like that. I have a lot of shit from back in the day, and I\u2019d say after \u201cPeso\u201d\u2014because we have Hood by Air in the \u201cPeso\u201d video\u2014by the time it hit 2012, 2013, he was ready. Because I was out there in the field. I just made that shit look jiggy\n\nAnd what about Been Trill?\nCome on, with the Been Trill. Don\u2019t even get me started because you know. People want me to answer questions they know the answer to. There\u2019s nothing to talk about\n\nAre you living a more private life these days? You weren\u2019t even at New York Fashion Week heavy this year\nI\u2019m not private like I think I\u2019m Michael Jackson or some shit. I\u2019m just trying to, I don\u2019t know, distance this space between me and social media. Me and...just media in general\n\nWhy?\nIt\u2019s the clich\u00e9: The media\u2019s good for twisting stuff up and making something out of nothing\n\nFor you, that\u2019s new. What changed?\nMaybe I came to the conclusion I just didn\u2019t wanna talk to some motherfuckers no more. Why do we go from liking blue today to red tomorrow? I don\u2019t know. Motherfuckers change. When I wanna talk, I\u2019mma do it. When I wanna be places, I\u2019ll go. I prefer to be free. And I feel like when you live that life of paparazzi, media, social media, when shit hits the fan, they\u2019re gonna be the same people that destroy you. So I don\u2019t wanna give them the credibility of making me, because when it\u2019s all said and done, the motherfuckers won\u2019t be able to break me\n\nWe talked about you being an artist before a rapper\u00ad\u2014\n\u2014There\u2019s a difference. Let\u2019s be clear on that\n\nDo you feel slighted when people call you a rapper?\nNo, because that\u2019s gonna happen. That\u2019s what I do. But I feel like nowadays, the term \u201crapper\u201d doesn\u2019t mean anything honorable\n\nHow so?\nWhen you walk through hotels in foreign countries, they assume you\u2019re either an athlete or a rapper. It\u2019s almost like: Rappers are becoming the new GED way out of things\n\nA few weeks ago, we talked about not rushing art. What\u2019s going on with the album? Is it ready?\nNo matter what, it\u2019s never enough time. You\u2019re always gonna say, \u201cWait, give me two more seconds. Let me get a couple more minutes.\u201d When you\u2019re a perfectionist and trying to craft a really dope piece of art, shit...\n\nWho were your muses for this album? And inspiration?\nMich\u00e8le Lamy, my relationship status, my social status, Danger Mouse, just my life, my current situation with A$AP. And drugs\n\nWhat kind of drugs?\nPsychedelics. Before it was all about the slowdown. Promethazine. Codeine flow. Now it\u2019s like that, but on another level to the max\n\nAre you still taking them?\nI use them to my advantage. It\u2019s not something I wanna fuck with all the time. That\u2019s the beauty of it. You can dip and dab with the psychedelics, but that ain\u2019t something I wanna keep doing. Nah\n\nWhen we were in L.A., you were listening to a bunch of different types of music\nI\u2019m going to be honest with you, man. When Yams died, psychedelic music healed me. Stuff like the The Mysterians, \u201c96 Tears.\u201d That\u2019s all the stuff I love. I love classic rock. Take the Doors\u2014those organs. It\u2019s why I love Danger Mouse\u2019s aesthetic\n\nI always loved the mantra of A$AP Bari\u2019s clothing line, VLONE: \u201cLive alone, die alone.\u201d How does that play into your life?\nIf you look at the concept of birth and death it\u2019s, like, I would rather be \u201cVLONE\u201d because you\u2019re born alone and you die alone\n\nIs that something you feel like you live consistently?\nFor sure. Especially when you got loved ones popping in and out your life and shit\n\nAny plans for the day the album drops?\nI might drop acid for A$AP Yams. Let me honor his name. \n\nI know you need your rock star moment. I know you need it!  You got it"

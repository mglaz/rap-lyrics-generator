'Cause I'm wearin' black shades\nAnd I'm headed west with the word of God (Amen)\nYeah, I think I'm finally ready to talk about it\nThese niggas just talk about it\nHomie don't play me for no fool\nPoppin' bottles like enemigos\nOs dios mio, I'm so cold\nGet so deep in that water, water\nThey should call my johnson a harpoon\n\n\nFeed the needy, don't know graffiti\nPaint her walls like a cartoon\nBeat the pussy up so bad\nSend her home with some war wounds\nLoaded off the 'gnac, hit her from the back\nGoin' 'cross her head, bar stool\nTouch her soul, 'til I curl her toes\nThen it's time to reload, then it's part two\n\n\nDamn near 30, still set trippin', cuz\nWhere you from? I'ma see about it\nLast year I made ten million\nThat's where I've been, yeah, a private island\nSmoking something, on autopilot\nGot too many cars, I might crash a whip\nNew 'Rari pedal barely tapping\nNigga, vroom-vroom, yeah, I'm rich, bitch\nGot two rollies, but one missing\nThink my daughter flossing, she in kindergarten\nGot one crib worth two cribs\nAnd my front lawn, yeah, that's water fountain\nYou be talking boss, saying big words\nLike philosophies, man, you weird homie\nWhat it sounds to me that you broke as fuck\nAnd your bitch gon' leave, and that's real, homie\n\n\nI got big money, big booty bitches\nMan, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)\nBig problems, I must admit it\nMan, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)\nBig dreams, no superstition\nThat shit gon' be the death of me (death of me)\nI pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope\nI can't stand myself\nI just bought a new coat, I just might go broke\nI can't stand myself\nI just might damn myself\nI just might...

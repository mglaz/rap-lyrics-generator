        "\nNever 'bout the money, ahhhh\n\n\nThe shorty get shot in the streets\n'Cause he ain't pay his fees\nIt's never 'bout the money (never 'bout the money)\nIt's never 'bout the money (ohh, ohhhh)\nThere's principles involved\nThese rules apply to all (all)\nIt's never 'bout the money\nIt's never 'bout the money\n\n\nDamn, why they do him like that? (Huh?)\nThey ain't even had to do him like that (huh?)\nFuck it, he should've had the llami on him (facts)\nActin' Holly, had to go Tommy on him (woo!)\nYou do dirt, you get dirt, that's how germs spread (word)\nSquash the beef with a funeral, it's confirmed dead (word)\nSee, it's never 'bout the money 'cause I burn bread\nIt's the principalities, like Big Worm said (hold up)\nBack to the wall, your man was on the Wizards (yeah)\nI weathered the storm while standin' in a blizzard (yeah)\nHandlin' your bid'ness almost landed me in prison\nSo I had to cut you off, but you handed me the scissors (damn!)\nSee after I lost you, I must've found me\nNiggas wasn't with me, they was just around me\nGotta know the rules in the streets you play in\n(What happened?) I don't even know but the streets is sayin'\n\n\nThe shorty get shot in the streets\n'Cause he ain't pay his fees (damn!)\nIt's never 'bout the money (never 'bout the money)\nIt's never 'bout the money (ohh, ohhhh)\nThere's principles involved (yeah)\nThese rules apply to all (all) (all y'all)\nIt's never 'bout the money (never, never)\nIt's never 'bout the money\n\n\nHA-HAAAEEH!\nUh, yo, if you beat him, you can't welp him (uh huh)\nIt's only a problem in the case when you can't help him (umm)\nThey even invite you to a place where you ain't welcome (wooh!)\nReliable source, who you gettin' your intel from? (who?)\nJewish lawyer on the retainer, they had to bill him (umm)\nInterrogation 'fore he arrived, they tried to drill him (yeah)\nIt's hard for you to stay on one side when you a villain (hard)\nYour heart sayin' yeah, but your pride won't let you kill him\n(Kill kill kill) nah, that's what happen when you love a nigga (love)\nThen he end up gettin' it from another nigga (uh)\nThe wrong way is usually how you rub a nigga (yeah)\nSometimes for you it's just easier to dub a nigga (one)\nWhatever issues they have, just let 'em keep those\nIt's 'bout the morals, principles and the G-codes (sometimes)\nYou gotta give one to take a blow (woo!)\nIt's never 'bout the paper though, what?\n\n\nThe shorty get shot in the streets\n'Cause he ain't pay his fees\nIt's never 'bout the money (never 'bout the money)\nIt's never 'bout the money (ohh, ohhhh)\nThere's principles involved\nThese rules apply to all (all)\nIt's never 'bout the money\nIt's never 'bout the money"

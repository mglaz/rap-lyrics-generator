        "\nGirl I know\nI know you bought me the watch\nYou ain't get it back though\nMy name's on the back though\nI flipped the lock to the back door\nAnd took the key under the mat though\nI know you hate that\nBut you did some things that you cannot take back\nI needed change\nLeft a nickel for a dime\nThat is a payback\n\"What you sayin?\"\nBitch I'm over you and I ain't playing\nShould've been a one night stand\nBut here we go again....\n\n\nI wish that I loved you\nOr that I cared\nOr that I'd even give a damn if you were here\nBut you're gone so it's fuck you\nI'm a player\nI am everything that you wanted but you're scared\nI wish that I loved you\nOr that I cared\nOr that I'd even give a damn if you were here\nBut you're gone so it's fuck you\nI'm a player\nI am everything that you wanted but you're scared\n\n\nPlease never call me\nDo not mention me in any stories\nDo not show up at the homie's party\nCome up to me and then say I'm sorry\nYou're just a\nYou just a \u2014 hold up let me stop\nThe Henny shots got the petty talk comin I don't wanna have them thoughts running\nCan't believe that I bust in a thot's stomach\nFuck is wrong with you\nI don't even get along with you\n(Not even a little bit)\u00a0\nBut the head was phenomenal,\u00a0\nUsed to do that in the car with you\n(True)\nUsed to travel around the world just for the rendezvous\n(Come through)\u00a0\nNow I gotta get high just to deal with you these are the chronicles\n\n\nI wish that I loved you\nOr that I cared\nOr that I'd even give a damn if you were here\nBut you're gone so it's fuck you\nI'm a player\nI am everything that you wanted but you're scared\n\nI wish that I loved you\nOr that I cared\nOr that I'd even give a damn if you were here\nBut you're gone so it's fuck you\nI'm a player\nI am everything that you wanted but you're scared\n\nI wish that I loved you\nOr that I cared\nOr that I'd even give a damn if you were here\nBut you're gone so it's fuck you\nI'm a player\nI am everything that you wanted but you're scared\n\nI wish that I loved you\nOr that I cared\nOr that I'd even give a damn if you were here\nBut you're gone so it's fuck you\nI'm a player\nI am everything that you wanted\nEverything that you wanted"

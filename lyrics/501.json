        "\n\n\nFor real though, like for real though\nLike for real\nYou know what I'm sayin', I don't even\nIt's like, niggas must forget who the fuck\nDid what the fuck\nWhen the fuck\nWhen niggas was still, not the fuck\nOr whatever\nFine then, I say\n\n\nDear Lord, have mercy on my banana clips\nGive 'em half, call it that banana splits\nBut my halves is really like a banana 6\nDo these bananas have any idea who they on the planet with?\nApes, yeah you bananas to the grapes\nThat mean your bitch got a banana in her face\nAnd wine on her chin, get these heathens off of my trunk\nAnd all of these swine up off my rims\nTryin' to take the shine up off of my Benz\nSLR, nigga please\nNiggas 'bout to go to work so these bitches gon' have to leave\nGon' roll around with that B-Y, nigga just roll up my sleeve\nGot body plans, so I karate stance so I could open up my chi\nLu the boy, too Bruce Leroy to destroy\nDoo doo beat like two T-boys with one freak one me\nBut I can DP like it's three more\nThree rewards for me or me or me or me or me or me\nTeam me is like meat eating animals meeting a meteor\nDinosaurs, I'm fine with all kinds of wars\nKnives and swords, lions, tigers bitin' boars\nLightening striking Viking hordes\nFighting heightened, violence soars\n\nThat was Adolf, reacting to my new shit\nTranslation: how come he can't be as evil as Lu get?\nWell that's cause you ain't Lu, bitch\nTook two sips of the holy grail\nThen I backed up and I turned around\nAnd I bent over and pittoo'd shit\nI love Jay, that's my nigga\nI feel sicker than a cruise ship\nI ain't competition, I don't move shit\nThe only opposition is this new shit\nThese new niggas rappin' like they 2\nThey be actin' like they you, man that's-- wheeeeeew shit\nWhat happened to the game?\nNiggas think they Jappin' cause they rappin' like they Wayne\nRappin' like they Chainz\nI ain't matchin' them in platinum\nBut I'm rappin' like I'm flames\nLike smackin' them in the back of him and my antonyms is on 'cain\nAnd my heroin is on metaphors and my metaphors is on brains\nMy left foot is in LA but my right foot is in Spain\nNow we all heard what he said, but what he said means we dead\nAnd that shit is insane\nHe's so crazy, look at the little baby\nNigga you ain't Nas, nigga you ain't Jay-Z\nYou will respect me, you will reject me\nBut I've done so much, no matter how far you go, you will reflect me\nSLR, nigga please\nThese niggas 'bout to go to work so these bitches gon' have to leave\nAnd when the bitch gone, knee shots disabled\nDVD of Dick Jones in your TV and a grenade all on your table.\nAnd my punch bowl's like an ocean\nAnd I lay it on by the ladle\nBut it's so strong, when I pull it out, I'm only hangin' on to a handle\nSatan on my ankles while I'm hangin' on to an angel\nAin't hatin' on that you hatin' wrong, cause you can't hang on to my angles\nIt's hard being a Lupe fan, go to Harvard to be a Lupe stan\nI ain't sayin' that I'm harder, it's just harder when it's in Lupe's hands\nWelcome nigga, Lupe Land, SLR\nHere we go, FL bars\nHold up, go back to the hard part\nWould say pause, but I was talkin' 'bout my own balls\nNigga"

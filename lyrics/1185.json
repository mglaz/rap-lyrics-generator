        "\nGood evening everybody\nI like to welcome y'all to the 'Go\nBut let me warn you\nBefore I take you on this trip\nKeep your mothafuckin head straight\nAnd your bitch better not have no purse\nLet's go\n\n\nOh so pumpis now laid back may back and the top is down\nThey use to say that I was a awkward child\nMade it hard for my pops to smile\n'Cause I was blocked by\nWhat you know about the city lights, top down blow tree\nFeel the breeze throught the city night\nThe 23s got me sittin right\nThe Cartier's on my sleeve, Frankie Bs got em fittin tight\nWe quick to get up when it bust down\nBut see its G's round here so nigga please do not fuck round\nThis for my niggas up in Bucktown, you know the business\nEvery fifteen minutes you gotta duck down\n\n\nWe send it up then we slide out\nBut if a nigga wanna fuck wit my nigga we finna grime out\nI tryin to tell you what the Chi about\n'Cause ain't no city like my city\n\n\nWe be ridin rollin rollin ridin it crazy\nWe smoking sippin sippin smokin baby\nWe be ridin smokin sippin pimpin baby\nI know you feelin me now\nThis is how we do it in Chi-c-a-go\n\n\nAnd we dont kick it on the late no more\nAin't no parties in the hood, we dont skate no more\nSee err'body wanna chase the dough, I sip Bacardi\nWith a shot of strawberries so i taste the dro\nI lay back and then I blow the haze\nOne for my niggas who were here before but are gone today\nDumpin out liquor, takin shots to make it go away\nDown on my note ready to go 'cause I don't wanna stay\nI'm on my way and i hope somebody call me back\nOr maybe i do it for my nigga, G, baller, scrapper\n'Cause when you look up in the sky you know he smiling at ya\nThis windy city got that Reaper steady coming at ya\n\n\nBut that's a common factor, we set it up and then we slide out\n'Cause if a nigga wanna fuck with my nigga we finna grime out 'Cause ain't no city like my city, you either with me or ride out\n\n\nWe be ridin rollin rollin ridin it crazy\nWe smoking sippin sippin smokin baby\nWe be ridin smokin sippin pimpin baby\nI know you feelin me now\nThis is how we do it in Chi-c-a-go\n\n\nAnd i remember rappin in staircases clappin them 12 gauges\nStackin them big faces praying to god i made it\nMy life is so funny mo drama mo money\nSo now they see me off that remy gettin so scumm\nReproduction, most of my niggas facin life or they on they way\nDepending on what  I'm makin\nSo now you see yourself real baby girl\nAnd I hope you ain't trying to bring it here baby girl\n'Cause uh, this ain't my occupation, this just a fuckin hobby\nHalf of y'all bitches waited on my album just to copy\nBut you sloppy and your verses will never top me\nA real lyricist and you bitches is carbon-copy\nNow producers wanna give me the boot\n'Cause they know I spit the truth\nAnd I can fuck they bitches up in the booth\nBut they still see me lettin it loose\nSee i make em feel the juice like a hundred-proof\nAnd the hook goes\n\n\nWe be ridin rollin rollin ridin it crazy\nWe smoking sippin sippin smokin baby\nWe be ridin smokin sippin pimpin baby\nI know you feelin me now\nThis is how we do it in Chi-c-a-go"

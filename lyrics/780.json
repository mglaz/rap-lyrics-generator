        "\nOoh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah\nOoh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah\n\n\nI am, the one you denied\nBrushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright\nI'm able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side\nIf you ready to ride, I'm down for a one night stand\nI'll accept it any way that I can, cause I ain't your man\nI'll try for whatever it's worth\nJust remember who played who first\nYeah, yeah\n\n\nI can't keep my eyes off ya\nI can tell why them other guys lost ya\nYour kind's rarer than a flyin' saucer\nAnd that's why I can offer, similarities in our characters\nHaven't you heard the word 'round town? How I get down\nThey gon' whistle, everybody part is official\nAnd that ass wit' you, got my dick as hard as a missile\nDon't hop on top, cause I ride around with a pistol\nIf they pull us over, I'll be out of town with an issue\nIf you was mine, I'd introduce you to mama girl\nYou're stylin' in your boots and Gabbana, I'm so used to your Prada\nI take trips cause out in Houston it's hotter\nThrow in that Al Green and juice the Impala\nMake my jewels and my collar\nYou had me feelin' like a fool when I hollered\nTryin' to squeeze in but you wouldn't bothered\nNow I ain't neither, soon as I realized that I ain't need her\nShe in a rush to get close to me but I ain't eager\nShiit...\n\n\nI am, the one you denied\nBrushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright\nI'm able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side\nIf you ready to ride, I'm down for a one night stand\nI'll accept it any way that I can, cause I ain't your man\nI'll try for whatever it's worth\nJust remember who played who first\nYeah, yeah\n\n\nLook I don't mean to bother you\nBut your sex appeal is remarkable\nYou make a G wanna walk around in park with you\nThere ain't no tellin' the kind of things I'mma start to do\nIf I get wrapped up on your ass too fast\nI could tell you feel the same cause when I asked you laughed\nSo I'mma leave it at that, take a hint and put in my math\nI imagine, you probably look twice as good in the bath\nAnd I'm buggin' cause I can see you right in the hood when I pass\nI'm never stable cause business is on my ass\nBut you could be the one that I visit before I dash\nAnd I admit, I've been the type to hit and split\nBut you can't blame me for the females that I been gettin' with\nCause, most of these broads has had they eyes on my grit\nTo the eager shit, and learned to be satisfied with the dick\nAnd, if you ain't worth it that's all you get\nI ain't gon' blame you, I'm gon' blame all you tricks\nCause...\n\n\nI am, the one you denied\nBrushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright\nI'm able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side\nIf you ready to ride, I'm down for a one night stand\nI'll accept it any way that I can, cause I ain't your man\nI'll try for whatever it's worth\nJust remember who played who first\nYeah, yeah\n\n\nIt seems like your attitude, only appears when I'm mad at you\nWhen several situations occur and that includes\nWhen I'm gone too long, ridin' through them avenues\nAs soon as I get home there's rumors and scattered news\nYou know my fantasies, am I feelin' things or can this be\nYour girlfriend tryin' to sandwich me\nMy heart's colder than sandwich meat\nCause I, come from the hood where the hammers be\nI move fast with a switch pace\nAnd pop a Listerine strip in, before you get all up in a bitch face\nMovin' your body like this\nGon' make me blow like a bottle of Crist'\nMan I don't know no one hotter than Twist\nYou got my temperature risin'\nFrom your hips and your thighs and\nAnd that glare in your eyes'll brighten up a horizon\nIt comes naturally, I don't bribe 'em\nIt's as easy as one, two, three and I slide in\n\n\nI am, the one you denied\nBrushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright\nI'm able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side\nIf you ready to ride, I'm down for a one night stand\nI'll accept it any way that I can, cause I ain't your man\nI'll try for whatever it's worth\nJust remember who played who first\nYeah, yeah\nI am, the one you denied\nBrushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright\nI'm able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side\nIf you ready to ride, I'm down for a one night stand\nI'll accept it any way that I can, cause I ain't your man\nI'll try for whatever it's worth\nJust remember who played who first\nYeah, yeah\n\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah\nOoh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah\nOoh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah\nOoh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah"

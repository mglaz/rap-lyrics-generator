Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me\nPut Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me\nOh, generation above me, I know you still remember me\nMy afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting, blam\n\n\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank (Innanet)\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses (Innanet)\n(Kisses, kisses)\n\n\nI will smoke a little something but I don't inhale\nEverywhere that I go, everywhere, they be asking how's it going\nSay the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned\nJesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God\nGod knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL\nCheck, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom\nLike she know me well, I mean normally\nYou see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil\nBut these kids these days, they get so high\nBurn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit\nShit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L\nElevated, train, and the craziest thing\nGot me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated\nRap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it\nProbably shoulda been dead or in jail\nDeadbeat dad, enough of that jazz\nAsshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass\nAre we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong\nRip, brain-dead, take a tug and then pass\n\n\nI think we all addicted\nYeah, I think we all addicted\nReally though, I think we all addicted (Yah)\nI think we all addicted\n\n\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)\nI think we all addicted (Kisses, kisses)\n\n\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\n\n\nI could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter, juicy\nUsed to be in a jalabiya and a kufi\nTrying hard not to be addicted to a groupie\nI ended up on an album cover in a Coogi\nYou see, I be still a God but a goofy\nYou be flowing about drugs and a Uzi\nThat's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes\nSometimes I'ma wanna make a movie\nAnd when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)\nAnd though my style freakish\nI could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron\n'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG\nKnow me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)\nNever scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics\nCooler like I'm off of codeine, low key\nDon't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing\nIf I don't know what I miss is\nI'ma end up figuring out that it's home\nAnd my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses\nThis is just a testament to the ones that raised me\nThe ones that I praise and I'm thanking\nI need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes\nAnd I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking\nNever too old for a spanking, IGH!\n\n\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank\nI got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)\nI think we all addicted (Kisses, kisses)\n\n\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses\n\n\n\n"

        "\nTogether we are, a powerful force, as one, mind, body and soul\nLet no evil enter nor attempt to reduce us because of the beliefs we hold\nAnd with this love, combined with our strength, we ward off pain and stress\nTechnician I am, wholeheartedly, in life and in death\n\n\nOkay I get it, I'm an F.O.N Freak of Nature\nBut the pen is gonna heat the paper\nWas a problem in a incubator\nMom and dad was a creature maker\nI never need the shaker\nThe beef from table, the teacher later\nNow you're the beast awakener\nI don't think the streets are safer\nMy misery seepin' through my delivery\nBitter we givers and they keep my figures, don't try to nigger me\nThe grave digger is hither, he is no kidder, see\nConsider the dark energy, sinner be inner me\nBlack diamonds all around callin' all the down definites\nWho saw the clown and now steppin' with that tall amount of big tech and shit\nAah-ooh - 3 times\nMy people they know what that defines\nWhat the people are lovin', and that's T-9\nHe rhyme and make 'em make a beeline\nThey 'bout to hate, make out the great\nThey mouth'll break if they don't pay off the cake\nStay out my face, you don't want me to lay out the fake\nFlip the sick and pray thou relate\nDamned and incredible straight out the gate\n\n\nWe are the darkness, but we\u2019re leaving\nWe are the gods that are deceiving\nWe are the painters of blind-faith\nWe are the children of your rivals\nHolding guns while reading Bibles\nGo ahead and seal your fate\nStraight out the gate\n\n\nYou see the face of EBAH on Tech Nina\nEvil Brain, Angel Heart I remain in the dark and anointed\nWith holy they console me when they know we\nSin got a hold of me, why they let go of me? I\u2019m double jointed\nI\u2019m wicked and I represent the sickness\nAll you fraudulents feeling I\u2019m falling offending the father\nI place you in the deepest darkest part of abyss\nNobody but you and without any food and no agua\nI blackened the sun on you bitches\nSat in the dungeons and ditches\nYappin is one of your glitches - halt it\nThe Kraken has come with the quickness\nBack and I\u2019m plundering chicks\nAnd laughing you dummies trip with Exalted\nTech N9ne\nFuck the industry, independents, we enemies to them and he that\u2019s blind\nThe champ is here, the vamp is near\nHuntin' you heathens, hella hungry and I\u2019m amped this year\n\n\nWe are the darkness, but we\u2019re leaving\nWe are the gods that are deceiving\nWe are the painters of blind-faith\nWe are the children of your rivals\nHolding guns while reading Bibles\nGo ahead and seal your fate\nStraight out the gate\n\n\nI am the public enemy #1\nFuck your fame, I became the name of a gun\nNow they parents hate Aaron because they sons\nAnd daughters wanna be martyrs believing in my art, ain't it young?\nAll I got is my balls and rap,\nI'm appalled that y'all want me to fall calling craps\nSuckers hate it, now they crawlin' back 'cause I'm tall as Shaq\nAnd I'm always up for brawlin' bats\nStrange Music saved my life\nI was fuckin' it then the music became my wife\nNobody on this planet can tame my mic\nCall me crazy, don't matter, fucking insane I like\n\n\nWhen the sun's beam melts\nEveryone screams help\nThen only one king's felt\nWhen telling all survivors welcome to Something Else\n\n\nAnd I say Kansas City\nWill always stay Kansas City\nYeah\nThis is Something Else baby!\nLets Go!\n\n\nWe are the darkness, but we\u2019re leaving\nWe are the gods that are deceiving\nWe are the painters of blind-faith\nWe are the children of your rivals\nHolding guns while reading Bibles\nGo ahead and seal your fate\nStraight out the gate\n\n\nI ain't knockin no more I'm breakin' in"

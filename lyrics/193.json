        "\nWe don't do the same drugs no more\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\n'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\n\n\nWhen did you change?\nWendy, you've aged\nI thought you'd never grow up\nI thought you'd never\nWindow closed, Wendy got old\nI was too late, I was too late\nA shadow of what I once was\n\n\n'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\nShe don't laugh the same way no more\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\n\n\nWhere did you go?\nWhy would you stay?\nYou must have lost your marbles\nYou always were so forgetful\nIn a hurry, don't wait up\nI was too late, I was too late\nA shadow of what I once was\n'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna\nYou were always perfect, and I was only practice\nDon't you miss the days, stranger?\nDon't you miss the days?\nDon't you miss the danger?\n\n\nWe don't (We don't) do the same drugs no more (Do the same drugs no more)\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\nWe don't (We don't) do the same drugs no more (Do the same drugs no more)\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs\n\n\nTurn it around\nI remember when\nThis age of pathetics\nDon't forget the happy thoughts\nAll you need is happy thoughts\nThe past tense, past bed time\nWay back then when everything we read was real\nAnd everything we said rhymed\nWide eyed kids being kids\nWhy did you stop?\nWhat did you do to your hair?\nWhere did you go to end up right back here?\nWhen did you start to forget how to fly?\nIt's so natural\nJust like Juicy Fruit\nWorks like a magic trick\nPlease give me half of that\nWe don't, we don't, we don't\nDon't you color out\nDon't you bleed on out, oh\nStay in the line, stay in the line\nDandelion\nDo the same drugs no more\nWe don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more\nWe don't, we don't, we don't\nDon't you color out\nDon't you bleed on out, oh\nStay in the line, stay in the line\nDandelion"

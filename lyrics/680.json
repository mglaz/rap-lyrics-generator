All my niggas dead\n\n\nI turn the news on when I smell death in the air\nI prove you wrong, I made it out of here\nI don't belong, I see my past everywhere\nDon't stand too close to me, eternal PTSD\nI got a war zone inside of my head\nI made it on my own, they said I'd be in jail or dead\nI've seen my brothers fall over and over again (Hunh)\nDon't stand too close to me (Igh), I got PTSD\n\n\nUsed to run home from the train stop (Yeah)\nRunning so fast, dodging raindrops\n'Member got robbed at the park once (Yeah)\n'Member thinking that that bitch probably ain't cocked (Yeah)\n'Member I was with my mama one time\nSeen a nigga through the glass hit a nigga with a bankshot (Bow)\nPoint-blank, head hanging off his tank top (Woo)\nWalked off, we drove off, went to GameStop (Skrrt)\nQuiet ride there, picked up San Andreas (Hunh)\nCertain things we ain't talk about, mama, we just prayed off\nWe seen it all, don't get involved\nCarry the weight of the world like a shawl (Yeah)\nConceal and revealing to people in court\nI still can feel it, I know that the world is evil in case you thought a nigga forgot it\nWhen my homie was bleeding out, another homie went in his pockets (Tsk)\nPlease do not run up on me, not even as fans, niggas get fanned\nDown on the Dan Ryan I'm flying, I'm scary as hell, I need me a Xan (Igh)\n\n\nThe days seem longer as life gets shorter\nWe know sex, drugs, money, all in that order\nAin't no structure, no peace, we've lost our order\nLeaving me with anxiety, fucking up my sobriety (Lil Uzi Vert, yeah)\n\n\nIt's a war zone laying inside my head\nI still think about all my niggas that's dead\nI'm too paranoid, yeah, I know you heard what I said\nI'm too paranoid, I make sure all my opps, they bled (Woah)\nDraining all my energy, no, I cannot sleep, uh-huh\nI'm affected by the streets, no appetite, I can't eat\nI only see red when I see, I think it's my PTSD (Damn)\nI think it's my PTSD (Woah), I think it's my PTSD, yeah (Woah)\n\n\nI turn the news on when I smell death in the air"

Skinny tall with the dreads, that lil' nigga be rappin' his ass off\nYeah, I heard she got surgery, still wanna clap from the back just to see if her ass soft\nGo like Harden with rockets, we blast off\nTried to throw us some bullets, but we made 'em fumble, like nah, you ain't gettin' that pass off\nFrom the block, now I'm takin' my mask off\nHit the gas like we racin', speed off in them foreigns and leave tire marks on the asphalt\nIt's gon' be R.I.P. once your ass caught\nHe like frontin', we knockin' his cap off\n'Nother day, a new chain or a MAC bought\nAll this ice got me freezin' like Jack Frost (4X)\n\n\nThat boy a bitch, that's his dad fault\nIf you play, then you lay, we can crash out (Let's go)\nWhen I up in his shit, bet it's man down (Boom)\nIn BOA, I'm pullin' them bands out (Cash)\nDOA, bitch, I get your mans off (Gone)\nA rockstar from the block, I stand out (Uh)\nCame from nothing, I fucked my advance off\nWhen I hit the game, with my flow, niggas ran off (No cap), fuck it\nI'm not your average joe (Uh-uh)\nWhen I leave the house, I tuck it, uh (Fire, fire)\nI'm rich, I don't shop on no budget\nHe clutchin', my lil' youngin want him a bucket, uh (Score)\nI hop on this bitch and run it (Uh)\nIf I said it, I seen it or done it (Uh, uh)\nThese lil' niggas never robbed nobody\nAin't caught no body, and ain't getting no money (Cap)\nWhere I'm from, it's sports or gunplay\nWe looked up to the killer and dealers\nBut even them niggas wan' make it out one day (On gang)\nFuck my first M, I been had hood fame (Yeah)\nTook off like I was on a runway (Yoom)\nI'm a star, but still post on the one way (Blatt)\nThem niggas talk, but they won't play (NLE)\nWe let them guns sing like the choir on Sunday (Yeah, yeah)\n\n\nHop on the scene and I'm thuggin'\nThis Glock on my hip, so you know that I'm clutchin'\nCatch me an opp, I'ma down him in public\nThe police keep askin', I'm changin' the subject\nThe way I grew up, man, a nigga was rugged\nWhy the fuck you got a gun? You not gonna bust it\nAnd a hundred some shots, I ain't doin' no tustlin'\nGive a nigga temptation like he David Ruffin\nI ain't gon' cap, I don't even like rappin'\nBut I love wrappin' them bodies and shit\nFuck the bitch, and when I get done\nI'ma up my Glock and then rob the bitch\nCatch a nigga when he clock out\nI'ma get him whacked at his job and shit\nAnd I don't know why the police keep fuckin' with me\n'Cause they ain't stoppin' shit, yeah\nSpin on your block like a remix\nShoot him in the face, get his teeth lit\nExtended clip like a broomstick\nShoot a flick like Netflix\nScratch an opp off the checklist\nI just bought a gun off Craigslist\nShoot an opp in the brain, I'm leavin' a stain, only thing you see is red shit\nIf the police behind, we keep duckin'\nMy gun need some drawers, it got nuts\nWhole gang, we strapped, don't test us\nIf a nigga play, he gon' get bust, yeah\nNLE the Top Shotta, don dada\nGot the bombs like Al-Qaeda\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"

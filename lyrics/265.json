        "\nI can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins\nBloodstream only way to make it to my brain\nI tried some others but man they just not as good as you\nGoing crazy 'cause I only feel this good with you\nMaybe I'm just not as strong as I once was\nWhen we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz\nI'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs (Drugs)\nNikki baby, I love you but now I gotta go\n'Cause in the end what happens you already know\nProbably wonder where I been at, I been laying low\nBut in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for (Paying for)\nAll these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that\nYou're the only girl I need I gotta have you back\nEven though you turn my lungs black (My lungs black)\nTell me where you been Jack (Been Jack)\nUh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary\nI used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing\nSkipping school with all my homies on some truancy\nBut when I ended things with her it was just you and me\nDoing me good, that's what I thought at first\nMe and you together, swear to God that's all that worked\nAway from you though man it's just so hard to work (Hard to work)\nUh, my heart is hard at work\nWe been together like ten years\nGoddamn, took me as young man\nEveryday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go\nWhat will they write upon my grave?\nA free man born as a king, who died as a slave\nBut everything he gave her was for nothing though\nOh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go\nYou got me tripping like a flight to Vegas\nAll this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous\nAll I know is I'm living the life I never would\nFinally let you go, I thought I never could\nDon't get me wrong, can't forget the times shared\nSeem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there\nTried to run but my legs won't\nI look away but my head don't\nI love it when you're fresh\nI love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath\nI hate it that I need you, Nikki\nBut I love it when I feed you, Nikki\nI hate that I bleed for you\nUh, I long and I need for you\nBut I love it when I taste you (Taste you)\nNothing can replace you (Replace you)\nI wish I could erase you, you\u2019re everywhere I go\nBut you're everywhere I long to be\nAnd all these other people that don't seem to understand\nI'm just a man they always ask what\u2019s wrong with me\nMan you're everything I crave\nYou're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave\nI'm a king, you're my Coretta\nBut lately, I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)\n\n\nSlave for the\u2014\nSaid, I'm a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)\nBeen a slave for ya\nI'm a muthafuckin' slave for ya\nSlave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)\nNikki, Nikki, slave for ya\nI'm a slave for ya Nikki\nI'm a muthafuckin' slave for ya\n\n\nAll handwriting on the album's artwork was done by Big Lenbo\u2014"

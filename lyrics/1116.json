        "\nShe's falling in love now, losing control now\nFighting the truth, trying to hide\nBut I think it's alright, girl\nYeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh\nShe's falling in love now, losing control now\nFighting the truth, trying to hide\nBut I think it's alright, girl\nYeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh\n\n\nShe's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her\n'Cause her last relationship was a disaster\nAccusations everyday, she didn't know why\nAll her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time\nShould've ended it before it started\nAll she ever got was broken hearted\nHe was cheating on her, trying to flip it\nBack on her like a victim\nNow she all alone and starting over\nNow she got baggage on her shoulder\nBut the new guy really loves her\nShe loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore\n\n\nShe's falling in love now, losing control now\nFighting the truth, trying to hide\nBut I think it's alright, girl\nYeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh\nShe's falling in love now, losing control now\nFighting the truth, trying to hide\nBut I think it's alright, girl\nYeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh\n\n\nDespite her past, she can't help the attraction\nHe tells her that he's nothing like the last one\nHe redefines in every way what love is\nShe fell for him and hasn't gotten up since\nEvery now and then, she goes off, though\nBeating on his chest like a bongo\nHe understands she's coming from a hurt place\nAnswers all the questions on her survey\nDoesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust\nDoesn't call her, \"Ho\" after hang-ups\nGive her everything she ever wanted\nAnd even though she still feels haunted\n\n\nShe's falling in love now, losing control now\nFighting the truth, trying to hide\nBut I think it's alright, girl\nYeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh\nShe's falling in love now, losing control now\nFighting the truth, trying to hide\nBut I think it's alright, girl\nYeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh\n\n"

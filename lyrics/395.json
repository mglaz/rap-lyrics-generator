        "\nNot tryna be in there\nNot tryna be cool\nJust tryna be in this\nTell me, how you choose?\nCan you feel where the wind is?\nCan you feel it through\nAll of the windows\nInside this room?\n\n\n'Cause I wanna touch you baby\nAnd I wanna feel you too\nI wanna see the sunrise and your sins\nJust me and you\n\n\nLight it up, on the run\nLet's make love tonight\nMake it up, fall in love, try\n(baby I'm right here)\n\n\nBut you'll never be alone\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nBaby, I'm right here\nI'll hold you when things go wrong\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nBaby, I'm right here\n\n\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nBaby, I am right here\n\n\nWe were shut like a jacket\nSo do your zip\nWe will roll down the rapids\nTo find a way that fits\nCan you feel where the wind is?\nCan you feel it through?\nAll of the windows\nInside this room?\n\n\n'Cause I wanna touch you baby\nAnd I wanna feel you too\nI wanna see the sunrise and your sins\nJust me and you\n\n\nLight it up, on the run\nLet's make love tonight\nMake it up, fall in love, try\n\n\nBut you'll never be alone\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nBaby, I'm right here\nI'll hold you when things go wrong\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nBaby, I'm right here\n\n\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nBaby, I'm right here\n\n\nGon, give love to your body\nIt's only you that can stop it\nGon, give love to your body\nIt's only you that can stop it\nGon, give love to your body\nIt's only you that can stop it\nGon, give love to your body\nGon, give love to your body~\n\n\nBut you'll never be alone\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nBaby, I'm right here\nI'll hold you when things go wrong\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nBaby, I'm right here\n\n\nI'll be with you from dusk till dawn\nBaby, I'm right here\n\n"

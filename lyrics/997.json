        "\nAm I out of my head?\nAm I out of my mind?\nIf you only knew the bad things I like\nDon't think that I can explain it\nWhat can I say, it's complicated\nDon't matter what you say\nDon't matter what you do\nI only wanna do bad things to you\nSo good, that you can't explain it\nWhat can I say, it's complicated\n\n\nNothing's that bad\nIf it feels good\nSo you come back\nLike I knew you would\nAnd we're both wild\nAnd the night's young\nAnd you're my drug\nBreathe you in 'til my face numb\nDrop it down to that bass drum\nI got what you dream about\nNails scratchin' my back tatt\nEyes closed while you scream out\nAnd you keep me in with those hips\nWhile my teeth sink in those lips\nWhile your body's giving me life\nAnd you suffocate in my kiss\nThen you said\n\n\nI want you forever\nEven when we're not together\nScars on my body so I can take you wherever\nI want you forever\nEven when we're not together\nScars on my body I can look at you whenever\n\n\nAm I out of my head?\nAm I out of my mind?\nIf you only knew the bad things I like\nDon't think that I can explain it\nWhat can I say, it's complicated\nDon't matter what you say\nDon't matter what you do\nI only wanna do bad things to you\nSo good, that you can't explain it\nWhat can I say, it's complicated\n\n\nI can't explain it\nI love the pain\nAnd I love the way your breath\nNumbs me like novacaine\nAnd we are\nAlways high\nKeep it strange\nOkay, yeah, I'm insane\nBut you the same\nLet me paint the picture\nCouch by the kitchen\nNothin' but your heels on\nLosin' our religion\nYou're my pretty little vixen\nAnd I'm the voice inside your head\nThat keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say\nAnd you said\n\n\nI want you forever\nEven when we're not together\nScars on my body so I can take you wherever\nI want you forever\nEven when we're not together\nScars on my body I can look at you whenever\n\n\nAm I out of my head?\nAm I out of my mind?\nIf you only knew the bad things I like\nDon't think that I can explain it\nWhat can I say, it's complicated\nDon't matter what you say\nDon't matter what you do\nI only wanna do bad things to you\nSo good, that you can't explain it\nWhat can I say, it's complicated\n\n\nThe way we love, is so unique\nAnd when we touch, I'm shivering\nAnd no one has to get it\nJust you and me\nCause we're just living\nBetween the sheets\n\n\nI want you forever\nEven when we're not together\nScars on my body so I can take you wherever\nI want you forever\nEven when we're not together\nScars on my body I can look at you whenever\n\n\nAm I out of my head?\nAm I out of my mind?\nIf you only knew the bad things I like\nDon't think that I can explain it\nWhat can I say, it's complicated\nDon't matter what you say\nDon't matter what you do\nI only wanna do bad things to you\nSo good, that you can't explain it\nWhat can I say, it's complicated"

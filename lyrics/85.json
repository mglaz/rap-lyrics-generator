Dumbo\n\n\nLight nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga\nRich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga\nStill nigga, still nigga\nLight nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga\nRich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga\nStill nigga, still nigga\n\n\nYou wanna know what's more important than throwin' away money at a strip club? Credit\nYou ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it\n\n\nFinancial freedom my only hope\nFuck livin' rich and dyin' broke\nI bought some artwork for one million\nTwo years later, that shit worth two million\nFew years later, that shit worth eight million\nI can't wait to give this shit to my children\nY'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine\nBut I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99\nI turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8\nI turned my life into a nice first week release date\nY'all out here still takin' advances, huh?\nMe and my niggas takin' real chances, uh\nY'all on the 'Gram holdin' money to your ear\nThere's a disconnect, we don't call that money over here, yeah\n\n\nLight nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga\nRich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga\nStill nigga, still nigga\nLight nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga\nRich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga\nStill nigga, still nigga"

        "\nI wanna be free\nI wanna just live\nInside my Cadillac\nThat is my shit\nNow throw it up (I throw that up)\nThat\u2019s what it is (that\u2019s what it is)\nIn my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)\n\n\nCan\u2019t see me through my tints (nah ah)\nI\u2019m riding real slow (slow motion)\nIn my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s (umbrella)\nI ain\u2019t got 24s (nuh-uh)\nBut I\u2019m on those Vogues\nThat\u2019s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes\nOld school like Olde English in that brown paper bag\nI\u2019m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had\nHello haters, damn y\u2019all mad\n30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?\n\n\nI got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive\nGot that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time\nI\u2019m rolling that roof off, letting in sky\nI shine, the city never looked so bright\n\n\nMan, I\u2019m lounging\nIn some shit Bernie Mac would\u2019ve been proud of\nLooking down from heaven like damn that\u2019s stylish\nSmilin\u2019, don\u2019t pay attention to the mileage\nCan I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120\nEasy weaving in and out of the traffic\nThey cannot catch me, I\u2019m smashing\nI\u2019m ducking, bucking them out here\nI\u2019m looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic\nNow I know what it\u2019s like under the city lights\nRiding into the night, driving over the bridge\nThe same one we walked across as kids\nKnew I\u2019d have a whip but never one like this\nOld school, old school, candy paint, two seater\nYea, I\u2019m from Seattle, there\u2019s hella Honda Civics\nI couldn\u2019t tell you about paint either\nBut I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours\nAnd roll on over to the dealer\nAnd I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer\nGot the keys in as I was leaving I started screaming\n\n\nI got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive\nGot that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time\nI\u2019m rolling that roof off, letting in sky\nI shine, the city never looked so bright\n\n\nBackwoods and dope\nWhite hoes in the backseat snortin' coke\nShe doing line after line like she's writing rhymes\nI had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind\nCadillac pimpin', my uncle was on\n14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone\nStealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron\nDriving smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes\n(Fuckin' lottery homes)\nTires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too\nMustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on\nMy dogs hanging out the window\nYoung as whoosh, fucking like we ball\nTryna fuck 'em all\nNever park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall\nMeet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw\nYou can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls\nI'm motherfuckin' awe-\n-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize\nGrip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs\nSee the lust stuck up in her eyes\nMaybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?\nOr does she want it low?\n'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you\u2019ll never know\nSo we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit\nGot a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it\nSlide 'til the gas is finished\nQ\n\n\nOff-black Cadillac, midnight drive\nGot that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time\nI\u2019m rolling that roof off, letting in sky\nI shine, the city never looked so bright\nGot that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive\nGot that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time\nI\u2019m rolling that roof off, letting in sky\nI shine, the city never looked so, looked so bright"

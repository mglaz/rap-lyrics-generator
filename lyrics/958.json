        "\nYup\nSaveMoney fuck nigga fuck shawty\nHP, INANNET\n\n\nYou could-you could hear my trunk bangin' hangin' out the windows\nSwangin' down your block with the birdy in my lap\nYou can hear my smoke, burnin' loud I'm back to business\nEarly in the morn niggas-niggas still rollin'\nAnd I think it's that weed got me, I'm tweakin'\nMaybe that lean got me I'm tweakin'\nPullin' donuts in the beam, homie I'm tweakin'\nBitch nigga you don't know me, stop tweakin'\n\n\nSound like Ray J and Chris Brown on Celebrity Deathmatch\nWhere the latter of the two get his neck slashed\nOr slapping a paraplegic with a pair of crutches\nOr wiping my ass with Rosie O'Donnell's mustache\nI got Martha Stewart cooking yola\nMolly in the cherry cola, rub it on your areolas\nShe let me cactus the cat backwards\nAnd vacuumed the seeds from out of my black backwood\nI'm an author without the aardvark\nPull tricks like Card Shark, thumbs up to the camera like Nardwuar\nWarhol & a Narwhal in an ark\nPark the yacht in the water hit your daughter in a smart car\nHeart colder than body parts frozen in ice\nChopped the digits leave the five fingers for the mice\nMight pull a suicide mission and dip with the doors up\nAfrican elephants in my tour bus\n\n\nYou could-you could hear my trunk bangin' hangin' out the windows\nSwangin' down your block with the birdy in my lap\nYou can hear my smoke, burnin' loud I'm back to business\nEarly in the morn niggas-niggas still rollin'\nAnd I think it's that weed got me, I'm tweakin'\nMaybe that lean got me I'm tweakin'\nPullin' donuts in the beam, homie I'm tweakin'\nBitch nigga you don't know me, stop tweakin'\n\n\nWhere do babies come from? Porkin' the stork\nPoorly parked pullin' into your Porsche with a Ford\n44 on the dash, put a dent in your door, close your mouth\nThe witnesses never make it to court\nBorderline stir crazy, crepes and beignet that's tasty\nEspecially drippin' with liquid rabies\nRail a adderall pill and cook mushrooms in my gravy\nPut a hit on every YouTube commenter who hates me\nI don't want to fight\nI just want a quiet life and a nice little suburban place to cry at night\nAnd an eye dropper filled to the top with cyanide\nSo my psychiatrist dies soon as she tries the Sprite\nSike! I love everyone! Goodnight, thanks for having me\nHope your mom's not mad at me\nAt Penn State yellin', \"Free Sandusky!\"\nDoes he know what he's doin'? He's tweakin'\n\n\nYou could-you could hear my trunk bangin' hangin' out the windows\nSwangin' down your block with the birdy in my lap\nYou can hear my smoke, burnin' loud I'm back to business\nEarly in the morn niggas-niggas still rollin'\nAnd I think it's that weed got me, I'm tweakin'\nMaybe that lean got me I'm tweakin'\nPullin' donuts in the beam, homie I'm tweakin'\nBitch nigga you don't know me, stop tweakin'\n\n\nI think the Illuminati is real\nAnd your body's the peel and your soul is the fruit\nAnd they goal is to steal and control all the juice\nI seen way too many pyramids, that's far from Khufu\nFoofoo niggas out here snakin' on the reggo\nYou should ask a snake where its legs go\nBut then again I'm smokin' on the medical\nGot the white owl look like an egg roll\nAnd that was Scooby snacks, Petco\nI'm a lunatic belong inside a loony bin\nI burned it down for you because I love you, now I'm movin' in\nOoh a condominimum, condom in ya enema\nBumpin' Kanye like it just came out\nNo songs with Kendrick, we just hang out\nThey say a smart man looks like a madman to a dumb man\nBut one man...wait I'm tweakin'\n\n\nYou could-you could hear my trunk bangin' hangin' out the windows\nSwangin' down your block with the birdy in my lap\nYou can hear my smoke, burnin' loud I'm back to business\nEarly in the morn niggas-niggas still rollin'\nAnd I think it's that weed got me, I'm tweakin'\nMaybe that lean got me I'm tweakin'\nPullin' donuts in the beam, homie I'm tweakin'\nBitch nigga you don't know me, stop tweakin'\n\n\nSawed-off shotgun, hand on the pump\nSippin' on a 40, smokin' on a blunt\nBust my gat the Internet didn't jump\nLa la la la la\nSawed-off shotgun, hand on the pump\nSippin' on a 40, smokin' on a blunt\nBust my gat the Internet didn't jump\nLa la la la la"

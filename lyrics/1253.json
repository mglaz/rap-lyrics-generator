        "\nThrough the night\nShe just want the tip, no advice\nOn the side of the road, what's\u2005the\u2005risk? Roll the\u2005dice\nIf they catch us, I don't\u2005care 'cause we all gon' die (Yeah, yeah)\nYeah, we all gon' die\nI was worried, to be honest, but it's all goin' right\nWhen I first laid eyes, I was awful enticed\nAnd I might be off something, but I'm all in now\nShe gotta call in now\nI don't think that you should work tomorrow\nShe said, \"First of all\nI'm still goin' in,\" like Rich Homie Quan\nBut with you and me, God, man, it feels so intense\nI already seen that movie but I will go again with you\nI got a few I been tending to\nBut tonight, I forgot all about 'em\n\n\nThrough the night\nI would try to get it tonight\nYeah, the phone on my head like, \"You better do right\"\nI'm alone in the bed, yeah, I know what you said\nBetter cope with it\nDon't take me for a joke and I won't get a friend that's tryna be more than that\nI'm convinced that it's sorta that\nWhen I seen you in the pics, I could tell you was forcin' that\nI got time for this\nMinus the bullshit, I'm cool now, look at my common sense\nAnd I'm just realizing this\nKnow my soul isn't trapped\nBut what's holding me back is the old me, in fact\nI'ma get intact, I'ma get it back\nMama, hold me to that\nJust, just, just hold me to that\nOn stack, me and Jack got the city on smack\nThat's word, huh, that's words\nUsed to catch 18 all the way to Newburg\nIt was only me and her, I don't care what you heard\nOnly me and her, I don't care what you heard\nGot a Southern accent, she'll slur a few words\nThat's virtue, sir, let me share a few words\nHey, let me share a few words\nFeeling unappreciated, let me cherish you first, yeah"

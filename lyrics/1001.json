        "\nOk, I lost my job last night\nPicked up my paycheck\nBut 35% of it's gone already cuz Uncle Sam ain't get paid yet\nMom and them bitchin bout this rent\nI ain't even gon' say shit\nAnd half of what is left goes to her\n(why?) Cuz I ain't use that latex, damn\nCheese sandwich and chips (meal)\nSlim just spilled his drink in my Toyota 96 (wheels)\nWell at least that blunt is lit\nDon't they say life is what you make it?\nThen I\u2019m tryna make it money\nAnd ride through my hood clean as Easter Sunday, that\u2019s wassup, uh\n\n\nAll my dreamer's put your hands in the sky\nAll my dreamer's put your hands in the sky\nOne time\nAll my dreamer's put your hands in the sky\nAll my dreamer's put your hands in the sky\nOne time\nFor the bullshit that you came from\nWorked hard to get away from\nBut the devils there and you just can't seem to shake em\nTwo times\nFor them long nights that you stayed up\nThinkin about that paper\nCrush it, lick it, split it, light it, blaze up\nFrom the mind of a stoner, from the mind of a stoner\nSimple thoughts from a loner, simple thoughts from a loner\nJust the mind of a stoner, the mind of a stoner\nSimpler thoughts from a loner, simple thoughts from a loner, oh\n\n\nParents aren't doin much now since little brother got locked up\nAnd I\u2019m stuck smokin this mid waiting for the weed man to get stocked up\nAnd my girl cancelled on me, said something else popped up\nAnd I can't get with my ex now cuz her ring finger all rocked up,damn\nNo one likes you when your 23 without a plan\nSit around in apartments all day smokin weed and I\u2019m like\n\"bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe\"\nTill I (skkrrrrrrttt) out in my Subaru and in the rear view is them lights\nI'm talking about red white and blue\nThe same color as our flag\nThe one's that they say salute\nBut the ones that's whoopin my ass\nAnd the same days that I\u2019m happy\nIs the same days that I\u2019m mad\nCuz I can't go 24 hours without shit happening to my ass, get high\n\n\nAll my dreamer's put your hands in the sky\nAll my dreamer's put your hands in the sky\nOne time\nAll my dreamer's put your hands in the sky\nAll my dreamer's put your hands in the sky\nOne time\nFor the bullshit that you came from\nWorked hard to get away from\nBut the devils there and you just can't seem to shake em\nTwo times\nFor them long nights that you stayed up\nThinkin about that paper\nCrush it, lick it, split it, light it, blaze up\nFrom the mind of a stoner, from the mind of a stoner\nSimple thoughts from a loner, simple thoughts from a loner\nJust the mind of a stoner, the mind of a stoner\nSimpler thoughts from a loner, simple thoughts from a loner, oh\n\n\nRollin up this weed\nThinkin about life\nAnd you know what?\nI'm good, yeah!"

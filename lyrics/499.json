        "\n\n\nFirst off, say \"Peace\" to Pine Ridge\nShame at all the damage that the white man wine did\nGhost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year\nAnd all that other crime did\nMore peace to the teachers of blind kids\nTo rebels in small cells keeping their mind big\nSay everything's hostile\nSuicide bombers and prosperity gospels, emaciated models\nWith cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils, they got to\nJust to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you\nStraight hair, high heels and a handbag\nCrucifixes, racism and a land grab\nKatrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags\nA peace sign and a pants sag\nA money toss cause a nine stripper mad dash\nA friend request following a hash tag\nNow everybody want it like the last laugh\nA Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask\nPurple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class\nStable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad\nBut corporate jets really had to have that gas bad\nWar and they hope they all fall from the ratatat\nCause that's just more dinosaur for their Cadillacs\n\n\nLive from the other side what you see\nA bunch of nonsense on my TV\nHeaven on Earth is what I need\nBut I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe\nReporting live from the other side what you hear\nA bunch of nonsense all in my ear\nRich man, poor man, we all gotta pay\nCause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way\n\n\nAnd we marvel at the state of Ottoman\nThen turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can\nAmerica's a big motherfuckin' garbageman\nIf you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem\nYou say no you ain't, and I say yes you is\nSoon as you find out what planned obsolescence is\nYou say no they didn't, and I say yes they did\nThe definition of unnecessary-ness\nManifested\nSay that we should protest just to get arrested\nThat goes against all my hustling ethics\nA bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective\nDepart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip\nInsert Baldwin, the similar, the separate\nTo me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit\nOr finding really fast internet to have some sex with\nIt's all one song short of a set list\nCouple croissants shy of a continental breakfast\nOr blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish\nSo absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace\nDown at the Lakota Sioux Casino\nA whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno\nI go as left as a heart in the chest\nCause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death\n\n\nLive from the other side what you see\nA bunch of nonsense on my TV\nHeaven on Earth is what I need\nBut I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe\nReporting live from the other side what you hear\nA bunch of nonsense all in my ear\nRich man, poor man, we all gotta pay\nCause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way\n\n\nAn all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler\nHope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar\nSouth Central an example of God's gifts\nSo shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6\nThe projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns\nMonopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound\nIt\u2019s parts of Manila like the video for \"Thriller\"\nBut the US Embassy is reminiscent of a villa\nIf poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla\nThen what\u2019s the flavor of the Sunday preacher\u2019s pedophilia?\nCash rules everything around these niggas\nAs classrooms everywhere around me wither\nHither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers\nThe tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the middle\nOf the extremes of America\u2019s dream\nFreud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now\u2026\n\n\nLive from the other side what you see\nA bunch of nonsense on my TV\nHeaven on Earth is what I need\nBut I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe\nReporting live from the other side what you hear\nA bunch of nonsense all in my ear\nRich man, poor man, we all gotta pay\nCause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way\n\n\nGreat American rap resurrect...\nLupe on the check\nWestside till I die!"

        "\nUh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah\n\n\nI'm a fuckin' walkin' paradox, no, I'm not\nThreesomes with a fuckin' triceratops, Reptar\nRappin' as I'm mockin' deaf rock stars\nWearin' synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks\nBedrock, harder than a motherfuckin' Flintstone\nMaking crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones\nThis nigga Jasper tryin' to get grown\nAbout five, seven of his bitches in my bedroom\nSwallow the cinnamon, I'ma scribble this sin and shit\nWhile Syd is tellin' me that she's been getting intimate with men\n(Syd, shut the fuck up)\nHere's the number to my therapist (Shit)\nYou tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin'\n\n\nUh, Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang\nUh, Wolf Haley, Golf fuckin' Wang\n\n\nJesus called, he said he's sick of the disses\nI told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline\nFor a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine\nAnd he's not fuckin' workin', I think I'm wastin' my damn time\nI'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal\nThis the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock 9's\nThis ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine\nBut after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time\n(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)\nAnd danced around the house in all-over print panties\nMy mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me\nI'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin\n(What you think of Hayley Williams?)\nFuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them\nI'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in\nAnd stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus\nAnd won't stop until the cops come in\nI'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders\nAnd pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)\nGreen paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers\nAll I want, fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need 'em\nBut where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em\nIt's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em\nSnap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves\nIt's been a couple months\nAnd Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave\nDamn\n\n\nUh, Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang\nUh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah\nGoddamn goblin\nWolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang\nUh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah\n\n\nThey say success is the best revenge\nSo I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in\nOh, not again, another critic writing report\nI'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork\nStill suicidal, I am\nI'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand\nI'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head\nAnd I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch\n(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G\nI just wanna know if my father would ever like me\nBut I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me\nA motherfuckin' goblin\n(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said\nThen it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead\nNow the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement\nActions speak louder than words, let me try this shit\nDead"

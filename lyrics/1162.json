        "Sometimes I be thinking bout if I had brought a son into this world how would it be for him seeing the way it is out here. Its crazy\n\n\nIf I had a son\nThis is what I'd tell em\nStay on your grind young nigga don't settle\nBe a man, stand tall on your feet\nDon't depend on nann motherfucker to eat\nSee mama gon show you how to always have a hustle\nThe streets don't give it we gon get it on the muscle\nYou my son\nLittle nigga pay attention\nNever be the talker baby always just listen\nNiggas gon reveal they hand\nIt's up to you to be the smarter man\nPlay chess not checkers\nCheckmate they ass\nKeep the mind of a warrior\nDon't let these niggas have you in the coroner\nIn this world you gon see a lot of pain\nWhole lot of evil that I really can't explain\nPeople gon change\nFriend turn foes\nNiggas turn snake\nTell everything they know\n\n\nIf i had a son \n\n\nAnd I understand\nIf you got to sell crack man\nCause this country ain't fit for the Black man system\nSo scandalous\nNow-a-days misdemeanors get you calendars\nBut hold your head up\nYou my little king\nDont let nann motherfucker crush your dreams\nI could show you how to beat and break all odds\nTeach you how to stay away from all mobs\nTeach you how to read them 48 Laws\nBlood in my eyes and the Art of War\nTeach you how to pray\nRead your bible\nDon't play, read your Psalms everyday\nAnd dont chase no chick, no broad\nAlways wear a rubber never run up in them raw\nI know you ain't here with me now today\nBut if I had you son this is what I would say\n\n\nIf i had a son \n\n\nRule number one: Always stay true\nRule number two: Respect who respect you\nRule number three: Death before dishonor\nFour: God is the only one that come before your mama\nRule number five: Always ride with ya fire\nRule number six: Never call a girl a bitch\nRule number seven: Don't result in telling\nCause all rats get buried off in the desert\nRule number eight: Respect your weight\nNever put more than a 7 on a 28\nRule number nine: Keep a militant mind\nDon't slip, make sure you always got an extra clip\nAnd rule number ten: Watch who you call your friends\nYou gon see who your friends when you need some ends\nI know you ain't here wit me now today\nBut if I had you son this is what I would say\n\n\nIf i had a son "

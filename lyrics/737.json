        "\n\n\nI rain, I rain, I rain, I rain\n\n\nPenny for a beggar, beg to differ\nThese just my lonely thoughts that sometimes get off with some liquor\nSo I don't drink so much no more at war wit my own picture\nWhat you thought it was? Cuz I ain't perfect as the dove in scriptures\nTight as two sisters but my favorite color black\nThey say the color purple royal soil on my back\nFrom the war that I been fighting just to make it off the map\nI was waiting for the sun to set, they intrigued with my black\nI guess the pitch is like my soul\nWorn out just like my Fo's\nI took the blue pill yesterday\nThe key to all my goals\nGoing over songs we like and songs we don\u2019t\nDon't wanna fall short as the gnomes and I have yet to visit Rome\n24 inches how we used to dream of chrome\nLast year my sister moved from New Orleans and she ain't need no loans\nWe light up like the scones when talkin money trees\nHow you don't eat pork but smoke holy on tobacco? Weed\nI never breath, another breed, Q, Phife, Ali Shaheed\nCheck the rhyme It's just my time to kill It like the purge this spring\nDeep as the valleys in the Philippines and up in Cali\nThey say this tape is like an album\nThrew one in the galaxy all for free\nMagna carter I been part of\nMy independent ass motherfucker they couldn't water\nDown look around the takeover dun took over\nAnd we been doing shit that you average rapper can't shoulder\nSo, what's next I suspect your death\nWelcome to the game where we trained to never follows refs\nLot of great players, but we as better as a team\nYou learned that watching Miami and the spurs just this spring\nScary as the ring in the well\nOn the scale I weigh like the Bronson or Adele\nI'm shell as full jacket metal\nMadame I replicated the summer of Sam, damn\nKill at ran-damn (random) Im like Van Damm stuck in a dam\nDamn, who is the killa? Wit agility\nFlow bend like that around Anguilla\nGot the skill of thriller\nCame from underground to get a mill or Two\nEveryday I've wrote, it seemed to wanna rain a few\nI guess I'll reign for you, Philly to NY\nJust to wet you up I\u2019m tear ducts to a dry eye\nMy my what he told me reciting OBI, Kenobi\n\u201cyou'll be the death of me solely\u201d\nI told him showly, I agree I'm Ali, cross um like Doji\nSting like wasps I serve um losses they lowley\nCall me young achilles cuz I snap on these like Kobe Now\nBack to talking bout my day it went smoothly\nI woke up hella early, last night watched a movie\nAnd compared it to my life like 2-D boobies, the come up, like the sun up, when ya son up mornings crying for juices\nAdolescents\nNever stress um\nDeveloped I bless um\nDenaun thanks for the blessing\nOne of the best in the game\nI still remain, outside still writing in the rain, I reign\n\n\nWhy don't you come home at night no more, no more\nWhy can't you see past a thing, no more\n\n\nYeah I see the gun but it's a pellet\nYeah the ball is in your court, but it's appellate\nThey sayin Acid was an album retail it\nI said I got way too much soul for me to sell it\nThat's why godfather tied the cape on my shoulders\nSaid save em from false prophets and wolves in sheeps' clothing\nI'm a little too hard to be slept on\nI'm a little too sharp to be stepped on\nA little too Pac for the septum\nI'm so pretty I make mirrors blush\nI spit the shit in a party to make your ear adjust\nI'm a parapalegic parrot with a pair of crutches in a no fly zone\nOn the phone talking bout how Bush trying to disparage us\nThere's a metaphor if I expound\nThere's a better score in the next round\nMe and raps go together like donuts and fresh ground\nCoffee, I'm awfully softly spoken\nIn Autumn, fall leaf clovin\nMy posters on dry wall and my banners are star spangled\nMy demons get charred, mangled, Chancelor the Archangel\nI don't pray for chart singles\nI grab life by the ankle like Kurt Angle\nAnd ask it if it's ticklish\nAsk me if that's ridiculous\nI'm a meticulous fickle dude\nThat just happens to spit a little bit\nAnd you can tell I rapped this off my phone\nCause you can hear that ringtone in the background but I'm in the zone"

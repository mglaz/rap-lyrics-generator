        "\nYou'll be my unregistered, sex offender\nWhen my mom and dad are both at work\nYou'll be my unregistered, sex offender\nI can lie about who ripped my shirt, ohh\n\n\nYou're my middle-aged angel sent from above\nYou're required to go door to door and tell them we're in love\nWe could be close together when you're far from your wife\nI think that scars are really cool. You should scar me for life\n\n\nIf we do something dirty, I can just take a bath\nAge is just a number, and I'm not good at math\nLet's take it slow at first; I wanna remember it all\nBecause I'm gonna show them where you touched me on a doll\n\n\nI know you think about me, when you're at work\nLets take a walk to your car and start an amber alert\nI know you're friends with my dad, so you're closer to me\nLets do tonight, and I'll repress the memories\n\n\nYou'll be my unregistered, sex offender\nI know how to keep a secret well\nYou'll be my unregistered, sex offender\nWanna bring your love to show and tell"

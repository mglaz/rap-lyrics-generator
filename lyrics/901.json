        "\nEarl on the beat\n\n\nRunnin' up bands, got my guap up\nAll the bad hoes wanna top us\nToo many wild parties on the yacht\nMe and Boat got kicked out the yacht club\n\n\nAyy, ayy, air it out\nPull up at your spot, and I air it out\nGang on the gas and it's very loud\nStop sayin' my name before you wear it out\nI been sippin' lean, tryna slow me down\nI need me a bitch that'll hold me down\nGang comin' strong, yeah we rollin' out\nThrow a party like Rollin' Loud\nAyy, don't come unless she stay in focus\nSoldiers at 10-4, sent your bitch the info\nFeelin' real blessed with Juice, that's my kinfolk\nBless up, she tell me I'm a god, get on her knees for confession\nSent a vid to her nigga, had to teach a lesson\nMe and Boat only want bad hoes in our section\nJuice, why these pussy ass niggas always pressin'?\nI don't know, let 'em talk, I'ma go get my Smith & Wesson\nBlessed boys under 21, steady flexin'\nI'm gettin' too rich, can't do flights with connections\n.40 on my hip, I won't fight, bitch I'm reckless\nCodeine what I sip, that shit come in straight from Texas\nReach for my chain, you'll get beat just like Nexus\nLamborghini dreams, but you still drive a Lexus\nI'm a young king, I might fuck Alexis Texas\nBut I ain't on no Drake shit, I won't get her pregnant\nDamn, young Juice WRLD, boy, you reckless\nAnd I feel you, until I get her naked\nWhen I get up in it, I might have to stay in\nWell if she goin' like that, let's run a train then\nFuck, I think I nutted in her, I might need a playpen\nAnd a stroller\nHow I get this deep? We rode her like a Rover\nNo games, but I XBOX control her\nShe do the gang like a nerd doin' homework\n.40 in my pants, that bitch thought it was a boner\nIf I go broke, I'ma juug off Motorolas\nBut now I'm up in France, Lil Boat, that's my mans\nWe get the green and then we fly around like Peter Pan\nThat's cool, but I just thought 'bout somethin', wait\n(What?)\nThis baby got your face\nSo fuck that lil' baby, boy's back to the place\nBack to the trap, back to the gang\n\n\nRunnin' up bands, got my guap up (Runnin' the guap up)\nAll the bad hoes wanna top us (They wanna top us)\nToo many wild parties on the yacht (Ohh-oh)\nMe and Boat got kicked out the yacht club (Out the yacht club)\n\n\nOh-oh-oh\nListen here, be alright\nShit hard"

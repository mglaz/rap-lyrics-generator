        "\nWhile all the time that I was loving you\nYou were busy loving yourself\nI would stop breathing if you told me to\nNow you're busy loving someone else\nEleven years out of my life\nBesides the kids I have nothing to show\nWasted my years, a fool of a wife\nI should have left your ass a long time ago\n\n\nWell, I'm not gon' cry\nI'm not gon' cry\nI'm not gon' shed no tears\nNo, I'm not gon' cry\nIt's not the time\n'Cause you're not worth my tears (Can't do it)\nWell, I'm not gon' cry (I said I can't do it)\nI'm not gon' cry\nI'm not gon' shed no tears (You were never worth my tears)\nNo, I'm not gon' cry\nIt's not the time\n'Cause you're not worth my tears\n\n\nI was your lover and your secretary\nWorking every day of the week\nWas at the job when no one else was there\nHelping you get on your feet\nEleven years I've sacrificed\nAnd you can leave me at the drop of a dime\nSwallowed my fears, stood by your side\nI should have left your ass a thousand times\n\n\nWell, I'm not gon' cry\nI'm not gon' cry\nI'm not gon' shed no tears (I deserve better)\nNo, I'm not gon' cry\nIt's not the time\n'Cause you're not worth my tears\n(Never gonna shed a tear, no)\nWell, I'm not gon' cry (I said I can't do it)\nI'm not gon' cry\nI'm not gon' shed no tears (I'm not gonna cry no more)\nNo, I'm not gon' cry (No, no, no, no)\nIt's not the time\n'Cause you're not worth my tears\n\n\nI know there are no guarantees (Guarantees)\nIn love you take your chances (Don't take chances)\nBut somehow it seems unfair to me (So unfair)\nLook at the circumstances\nThrough sickness and health, 'til death do us part\nThose were the words that we said from our hearts\nSo now when you say that you're leaving me\nI don't get that part\n\n\nI was your lover and your secretary\nWorking every day of the week\nWas at the job when no one else was there\nHelping you get on your feet\nEleven years I've sacrificed\nAnd you can leave me at the drop of a dime\nSwallowed my fears, stood by your side\nI should have left your ass a thousand times\n\n\nWell, I'm not gon' cry (Again, and again, and again)\nI'm not gon' cry\n(I said I should've been gone, gone, gone, gone)\nI'm not gon' shed no tears\nNo, I'm not gon' cry (I'm not gonna cry)\nIt's not the time (It's not worth the time)\n'Cause you're not worth my tears\nWell, I'm not gon' cry\n(I'm not gonna shed a tear 'cause you lied)\nI'm not gon' cry\nI'm not gon' shed no tears (I'm not gonna cry)\nNo, I'm not gon' cry (I said I can't do it)\nIt's not the time\n'Cause you're not worth my tears\n(You were never worth my tears)\n\nWell, I'm not gon' cry (No, I'm not gonna cry)\nI'm not gon' cry\nI'm not gon' shed no tears (All the tears I cried)\nNo, I'm not gon' cry\nIt's not the time (I'm not gonna shed a tear)\n'Cause you're not worth my tears (But you're wrong)\nWell, I'm not gon' cry (But you're wrong)\nI'm not gon' cry (You're wrong)\nI'm not gon' shed no tears (I'm not gonna shed a tear)\nNo, I'm not gon' cry\nIt's not the time\n'Cause you're not worth my tears"

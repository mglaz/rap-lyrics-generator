It's time to put this up\nYeah\n\n\nShoutout my label, that's me\nI'm in this bitch with TB\nI'm in this bitch with 4 Trey\nI just poured up me an eight\nReal nigga all in my face\nFive hundred racks in my safe\nFive hundred racks to the plug\nWhat you know 'bout showin' love?\nWhat you know 'bout pullin' up in Bentley trucks?\nMake these bitches fall in love\nAll of my niggas on go\nNone of my niggas no hoes\nAll of my niggas want smoke\nAll of my niggas together\nWe came from the bottom, we used to wear each other's clothes\nNone of my niggas gon' fold\nCouple pussy niggas told\nThey ain\u2019t my niggas no more\nHold it down for the four\nIn the nine with the woes\nMarlo my dawg, that's for sure\nWe won't fall out about shit\nSpecially not 'bout no bitch\nWe ain't gone fall out 'bout hoes\nMe and Ced get them loads\nWe let 'em go for the low\nI got my hood in control\nI got my left wrist on froze\nI got my right wrist on froze\nI got my necklace on froze\nBoth of my ears on froze\nI been gettin' faded, I'm sippin' on maple\nIf she won't fuck, I won't make her\nI don't like bitches with makeup\nIf she want titties, I pay for 'em\nGet outta there when I wake up\nI pass the ball, I don't layup\nI'm a big boss, I got say so\nThey'll wipe you down if I say so\nDracos, on Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos\n.40's, on .40's, on .40's\nI just bought me some new water\nWetter than Katrina, shoutout New Orleans\nI made a promise my niggas gon' ball\nHard in the paint, change my name to John Wall\nGeekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall\nFind a new plug then we takin' em all\nPull up in a brand new Benz truck\nHop out fresher than a menthol\nLil nigga, but I'm big dawg\nAll I gotta make is one call\nHit a nigga block, took off\nCross a nigga up, Hot Sauce\nOoh, I got 'em mad, my fault\nTalkin' 'bout the shit that I bought\nPoppin' these Percs, I done turned to a savage\nHundred racks stuffed in the mattress\nHundred racks stuffed in the attic\nHundred racks stuffed in the sofa\nThese niggas play gangster, but they won't approach me\nI know they'll never approach me\nThey know that they'll catch a bullet\nI rock the gang to the fullest\nI run with some real ones, I don't hang with no pussies\nI ain't no killer, don't push me\nI see how you niggas be lookin'\nI hope you don't think you no bully\nI'm livin' the life, I should star in a movie\nRidin' in a Vert with an Uzi\n12 get behind me, I lose 'em\nThey tryin' guess what I'm doin'\nThey tryin' guess who I'm screwin'\nThat ain't even they business\nThey ain't wanna fuck with me\nNow they see a nigga drippin'\nNow they wanna fuck with me\nThey can't get in touch with me\nHardly ever in the city\nThey just know I'm gettin' bigger\nThey just know a nigga busy\nI been runnin' up them digits\n\n\nYeah"

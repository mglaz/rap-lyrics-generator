        "\nBiggest boss and I've been the trillest\nI'm a bigger problem when I click with Skrillex\nMurder on my mind, it's time to pray to God\nMy revolver's not religious, the revolution's born\nYou wanna know my name then go and tell the sarge (What?)\nYou wanna know my gang: Suicide Squad\nPistol on my waist, I might make a mistake (What?)\nDeadshot, head shot, oh my God, am I crazy? (Oooh)\nDrugs every corner, this is Gotham City\nKiller Croc came to kidnap you to cut out your kidney (Oooh)\nAin't no mercy, got that purple Lamborghini lurkin'\nRozay, don't you know that pussy worth it? (Oooh)\nFlooded Rolex at the Grammy awards\nThey still sellin' dope, that's those Miami boys\nKillers everywhere, it ain't no place to run\nForgive me for my wrongs, I have just begun\n\n\nAin't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy\nGot that purple Lamborghini, purple Lamborghini lurkin'\nAin't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy\nGot that purple Lamborghini lurkin' (Rozay!)\n\n\nDon't be beggin' for your life 'cause that's a lost cause\nHigh stakes, body armor, suicide, boy (Ha, ha, ha)\nIt's a time for games and it's a time to kill\nMake up your mind, baby, 'cause the time is here\nCapital murder, capital letters\nYeah, she catchin' my vibe, but she can't fathom my cheddar (Woah)\nNeed a couple gang members for these new endeavors\nFrom this point on anything we do we do together (Oooh)\nBody on the corner, million in the trunk\nSeven figures, I spend that every other month\nKillers on the corner, talons in the clip\nBuild a palace out in Paris just to fill with bitches\nSay my name and I\u2019m coming with the gun squad\nEverybody runnin', homie, there's only one God\nCocaine white Ferrari, I'm in the fast lane\nEvery day was life and death, that's when the cash came\nCount money, drug residue, even blood on 'em\nHe had a driver 'til I put my cuz on it\nKickin' in the door, boy, Suicide Squad (Woah)\nNeedle in my arm so I'm do or die for it\n\n\nAin't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy\nGot that purple Lamborghini, purple Lamborghini lurkin'\nAin't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy\nGot that purple Lamborghini lurkin', (Rozay!)\n\n\n(My name is Skrillex)\n(Maybach Music)\nPower\nGreed\nDevious\nNeeds\nHighstakes\n(Cash money)\nDope boy\n(Rap money)\nRenzel, real hip\nForgive me for my wrongs, I have just begun\n(Rozay!)\n(Begun, begun)"

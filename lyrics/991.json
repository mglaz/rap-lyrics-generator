        "\nOpen up the champagne, pop!\nIt's my house, come on, turn it up\n\n\nHear a knock on the door and the night begins\n'Cause we done this before, so you come on in\nMake yourself at my home, tell me where you been\nPour yourself something cold, baby, cheers to this\n\n\nSometimes you gotta stay in\nAnd you know where I live\nYeah, you know what we is\nSometimes you gotta stay in, in\n\n\nWelcome to my house\nBaby, take control now\nWe can't even slow down\nWe don't have to go out\nWelcome to my house\nPlay that music too loud\nShow me what you do now\nWe don't have to go out\nWelcome to my house\nWelcome to my house\n\n\nMorning comes and you know that you wanna stay\nClose the blinds, let's pretend that the time has changed\nKeep our clothes on the floor, open up champagne\nLet's continue tonight, come on, celebrate (that's how we do)\n\n\nSometimes you gotta stay in\nAnd you know where I live\nYeah, you know what we is\nSometimes you gotta stay in, in\n\n\nWelcome to my house\nBaby, take control now\nWe can't even slow down\nWe don't have to go out\nWelcome to my house\nPlay that music too loud\nShow me what you do now\nWe don't have to go out\nWelcome to my house\nWelcome to my house\n\n\nWelcome to my duck off the crib, the spot, the pad\nBut my house is your house if you throwin' it back\nExcuse me if my home's draining the sad\nSoon as these happy faces land you can run with the cash\nHomerun, slam dunk, touchdown pass\nMi casa es tu casa so it ain't no holding back\nAnother shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass\nIt's my house, just relax\n\n\nWelcome to my house\nBaby, take control now\nWe can't even slow down\nWe don't have to go out\nWelcome to my house\nPlay that music too loud\nShow me what you do now\nWe don't have to go out\nWelcome to my house\nWelcome to my house\nWelcome to my house\nIt's my house"

        "\nAin't no game, I'm takin' all you have\nAnd you're gonna pay for it\nI don't know if I can stop myself\nAnd you're gonna pay for it\nOh, you'll never learn\nI touch fire, little burn\nThis ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have\nAnd you're gonna pay for it\n\n\nIt's a heavy load, I stroll on a bumpy road\nNo jacket when I was cold, becomin' one with my soul\nStand toe to toe with my foes, these wolves in sheep clothes\nNo weapon on me shall prosper, nigga, you better watch it\nYou playin' with fire, burnin' you slow, hold up\nI hear the whispers wishin', it's all cheap voodoo\nI keep it cool to keep from goin' coo-coo\nWith a cal', aimin' at fake smiles and turn them upside down\nCame too far for my feet to fail me\nLord, if I'm wrong you can help me now, hold up\nWait a minute, what am I sayin'?\nThe Devil, he busy, tryna get me everyday in every way\nI won't let up, I won't shut up\nYou can't stop me, you won't knock me, ten-four, now copy\nLive almighty, my declaration been written\nIn hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain, now listen\n\n\nAin't no game, I'm takin' all you have\nAnd you're gonna pay for it\nI don't know if I can stop myself\nAnd you're gonna pay for it\n\n\nI tell 'em all to hail King Kendrick, resurrectin' my vengeance\nBeen dissectin' your motormouth, 'til I break down the engine\nThis ain't no warnin' shot, this a relevant henchman\nSee my opponent, then \u2014 cease your existence\nEndin' our friendship, baby, I'd rather die alone\nYour diaphragm is dietary, what you eatin' on?\nCapture your audience with these words, boy\nThe holy Chapel, the tabernacle, the book of Matthew\nAnd Jesus starin' at you, take your turn, boy\nSee? It's gon' take a whole lot of y'all to kill me\nSee? It's gon' take a whole tribe of y'all to kill me, I never die\nMy pedigree apparently only to idolize\nAhead of me is only my future and idle time\nLongevity, I gotta get used to makin' you mine\nYou tellin' me I only get used to livin' if fine\nYou can never live in my shoes, permanently paid from God\n\n\nWhen the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die\nBut I will never die, my legacy is alive\nWhen the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die\nBut I will never die, my legacy is alive\n\n\nI gotta get it off my chest, push words just like weight\nI got to eat 'til it shows on my face\nTragedy turned to triumph, I'm tryin' just to relate\nJumpin' off of them towers, I'm takin' that leap of faith\nPlayin' at high stakes\nNow when I speak, their pupils'll dilate\nTheir speakers'll vibrate\nKnow you feelin' the vibe, that vine couldn't relate\nThis next clip is long, a son of a gun, big numbers\nDo the math, now cover the sum\nI come from the slums, we come for the funds\nLike run it, under the sun where niggas livin' their life blunted\nCountin' the ones, but truthfully nothin' like hundreds\nKeep it one hundred\nRoadblock in front of me, Look, I'm runnin' through it\nStick and move it, sippin' that Hennessy\nThis my gutter fluid, nothin' to it\nWhat we lost, we gon' make it back\nLike it wasn't missin', now listen, you 'bout to pay for that\n\n\nOh, you'll never learn\nI touch fire, little burn\nThis ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have\nAnd you're gonna pay for it"

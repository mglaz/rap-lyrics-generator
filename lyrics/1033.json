        "\nTell myself I don't need it, but I can't deny\nTried to buy my freedom, but the price too high\nDon't know how you got me speedin'\nNow I'm caught up in a feelin'\nYou blind my conscious\nI just know how bad I want this, I want you\n(Runnin' all these yellow lights to get to you)\n\n\nYou left your name on it\nNow it's too late for me\nPleasure all my pain away\nIt's my favorite remedy\nThese lights guide the way for me\nNo crowds, just these empty streets\nMission: let you get it\nHeaven once you get it\nIf you let it, oh\n\n\nI want you, take it, take it\nMake it new, crave it, crave it\nCan get used to it, to it\nYou're the proof, prove it, yeah\n\n\nThat's why I like you\nI don't have to show you what to do\nStarving from this other wants some you\nGettin' closer every minute\nI can't wait to get up in it\nRunnin' all these yellow lights to get to you\nAll these yellow lights to get to you\nMake me yours tonight, I won't refuse\nGettin' closer every minute\nI can't wait 'til you're up in it\nRunnin' all these yellow lights to get to (you)\n\n\nYou sink your fangs into me\nNext taste, just a mile away\nYour space so magnetizing\nIs you ready? Oh\n\n\nI want you, take it, take it\nMake it new, crave it, crave it\nCan get used to it, to it\nYou're the proof, prove it, hey\n\n\nThat's why I like you\nI don't have to show you what to do\n(I don't have to show you)\nStarving from this other wants some you\nGettin' closer every minute\nI can't wait to get up in it\nRunnin' all these yellow lights to get to you (You)\nAll these yellow lights to get to you (Lights to get to you)\nMake me yours tonight, I won't refuse (Won't refuse)\nGettin' closer every minute (Every minute)\nI can't wait til you're up in it (You're up in it)\nRunnin' all these yellow lights to get to (you)"

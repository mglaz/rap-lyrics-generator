        "\nI wear my emotions on my sleeve you know what I'm saying\nI've always been like that, my whole life, man\nIf I fuck with you, I'm all the way out there\nIf I don't fuck with you\nI don't mind you knowing I don't fuck with you\n\n\nBreaking down a key of coke, I ain't never seen a boat\nKhaza got circumcised thinkin I'mma need a load\nBoobie he a shooter hit the top of your medulla\nFrom a scooter with a ruger I don't think he even need a scope\nAttending college been a goal that I'm after\nEvaded doin' life without parole wearin' shackles\nI'm only fucking with what matters\nA washed up rapper talking trash doesn't matter\nFront windshield of the car went in shatters\nMy nigga brains blown out layin' in my lap\nTold God take me, everybody blamed me\nPraying till I'm prayed out won't bring him back\n\n\nThey say my life is amazing\nFunny been a question kinda wonder how I made it\nForest Gump and I got something in common\nThe world treat you different when brilliant\n\n\nWe ain't booted off a molly, we don't do shrooms\nAll we do is pass gas loud, excuse who?\nTwin-turbo 911 make it vroom vroom\nWe in all black, my mechanic, make the tool move\nSay you sip lean, yeah, I do too\nI ain't tryna hit your cup, nigga, do you\nI'm Michael Jackson, I'm reincarnated\nI channel this spirit like Ali the greatest\nMedicinal marijuana, am I medicated?\nAerosmith jaded\nShe looked like Nala when she got on top me\nI gazed in her eyes and responded\nCan we go half on a baby?\nBroke another fingernail scratching up my back\nNavel was to the ceiling when I'm pushing on her pelvis\nSee my tattoo of Elvis when I'm tearing up her cat\nShe tapped\n\n\nI'm a perfect imperfection\nMy craft has been perfected\nI just need affection\nEmotionally, Imma introvert but it comes off as aggression\nNo one understand me and everybody can't be slow\nIt's refreshing to find someone who think like me so I can't be wrong\nI'm a perfect imperfection and I don't find interest in the radio\nSo everytime I get high I watch the time pass by like away we go\nIs it okay to cry when you're dying inside?\nSeem like codeine is the one thing that help take my mind from the lies\n\n\nPoint the flame at my brain with the full clip\nDrake said Gates do his thing he don't bullshit\nAll you other niggas rap about is bullshit\nStudio on drugs and you get all in your feelings\nLook into your eyes nigga you ain't ever lived it\nBut always talking cooking dope nigga ever had heart ache\nEver lost money learning how to cook oil based\nEver grind hard tryna pay for your lawyer?\nGet him paid off and you still go to jail\nAnd that bitch that you love don't pick up when you call her\nFuckin' with your nigga when you get out and you dog her\nGoing with your mood with a nigga you don't argue\nCame here to die in the game I'm retarded\nKnow its got a name I ain't knowing what to call it\nMama 3 way the call chopping game, me and 40\nFreeman I look to you nigga and I love you\nKnow you lost your parents but with me you got a brother\nMalaki and Chris Sprite all same trap\nCousin Lil Quick telling me he wanna rap\nUptown Beezy the white house administration\nGet the paper had to see Tyrese in a scrap\nWhen his seatbelt strap make it hard to lean back\nSittin' up straight in the car with the shades on\nYoung Seven with the jensen and my main man gone\nI was doing time up in rivers when he came home\nNow I'm waiting on a nigga for the get out of line\nNo drive by we jump out and dump where you grind\nExcuse me I meant to say where you spend time\nYou too scared to hustle you just wasting time\nI used to spend nights with Khalil and Jaquincy\nAnd his brother fucked with the ones who against me\nStop making threats cause I swear I hate livin'\nYou say you don't like me well shut up or kill me\nWell shut up or kill me\nYou say you don't like me well shut up or kill me\nBitch shut up or kill me\n\n\nI'm a perfect imperfection\nMy craft has been perfected\nI just need affection\nEmotionally, Imma introvert but it comes off as aggression\nNo one understand me and everybody can't be slow\nIt's refreshing to find someone who thinks like me so I can't be wrong\nI'm a perfect imperfection and I don't find interest in the radio\nSo everytime I get high I watch the time pass by like away we go\nIs it ok to cry when you're dying inside?\nSeem like codeine is the one thing that help take my mind from the lies"

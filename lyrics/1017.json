        "\n\n\nLet's have a moment of silence for those that ain't here right now\nI know you're up in heaven smiling down\nYou might be gone, but never forgotten\nFlowers for the dead\nAt times, I still hear your voice in my head\nBut I wish you was here instead\nAnd all our precious memories, I'll never forget\n\n\nTwin, we've been best friends ever since we were little kids\nSo I sit and reminisce on all the things we ever did\nI remember all the stupid shit I can't forget\nHope God forgive us for our sins and give you the strength to live\nFar from sensitive, but I'm shedding tears right now\nCause I'm watching you fight for your life and I can't help out\nMeanwhile, the doctor's shocking your chest, checkin' for breath\nI was with you from the stretcher to the hospital bed\nNot believing it yet, everybody sad and depressed\nCounting your blessings, prayin' and prayin', hoping for the best\nWaitin' in bed, your wife duke shaking from stress\nBreaking in tears and fear, cause dog, she love you 'til death\nNext thing you know, the doctor comes out, just shaking his head\nNothing was said but I betted in his face full of sweat\nYou were dead, just all I saw instead was blood shot red\nAnd I felt a chill through my body that I'll never forget\nGod bless you\n\n\nFlowers for the dead\nAt times I hear your voice still in my head\nWishing you were here instead\nThese precious memories I can't forget\n(La flore pa' los muertos)\nFlowers for the dead\nAt times I hear your voice still in my head\nWishing you were here instead\nThese precious memories I can't forget\n\n\nIn my sleep, I hear you speaking to me and feel you reaching to me\nWish I could see you, though I know you with me spiritually\nPhysically, right here besides me is where I need you to be\nKeeping me company and take over this whole industry\nMemories of when we used to be too deep in the streets\nIf there was beef, we had each others backs naturally\nIf there was need for me to grab the heat, you'd grab it from me\nAnd blast off with no remorse just as long as its me\nYoung indeed, we sat and chat on the block puffing trees\nGuzzling Hennessy, playing knuckles 'til one of us bleed\nYou used to eat Rocks and read encyclopedias to me\nYou was a genius, even though you had no college degree\nWe were homies, but you will always be a brother to me\nSo close, we always gave each other kiss on the cheek\nBig P, your legacy will always live on the street\nAnd best believe I'm a be there for your wife and three seeds\nRest in peace\n\n\n\n\nYeah, this is dedicated to the ones who never made it\nI hated the fact you faded away, you were the greatest\nSo I say this prayer to pay my respects, I'll never forget you cause you special\nI'll catch you in my heart, may God bless you\nRest in peace to my peoples who passed away\nBest believe I'm a keep you alive always\n'Til the day we meet again, face to face with a grin\nIn Hell or Heaven, you my twin to the end\nAnd I'm a miss you\n\n\nFlowers for the dead\nAt times I hear your voice still in my head\nWishing you were here instead\nThese precious memories I can't forget\n(La flore pa' los muertos)\nFlowers for the dead\nAt times I hear your voice still in my head\nWishing you were here instead\nThese precious memories I can't forget\n\n\nRest in peace, nigga\nI know you chillin', I know you chillin'"

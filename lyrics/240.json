        "\nWith all due respect\nI don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel\nScreamin', \"Black Lives Matter\"\nAll the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills\nYellin', \"Nigga,\" this, and, \"Nigga,\" that\nCall everybody, \"Nigga,\" and get a nigga mad\nAs soon as I say, \"Nigga,\" then everyone react\nAnd wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black\nWell pound that, then\nTalkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then\nLike you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then\nLike you was on the plantation gettin' down back then\nAight, look\nI see a black man aimin' his gun\nBut I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son\nAnd I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean\nYou still trapped in a rut\nAnd I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?\nSo you can keep livin' on free government assistance?\nFood stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em\nFor some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?\nWhile you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?\nYou already late\nYou motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait\nIt's like you're proud to be fake\nBut you lazy as fuck\nAnd you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight\nAnd then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face\nYou can't escape problems\nYou can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar\nGot nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald\n\"They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom\"\nMy voice been back\nI'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black\nI'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black\nMy head's in the cloud\nHeard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house\nMaybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out\nOr maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now\nI'm not racist, and I never lie\nBut I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine\nI worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs\nBut you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God\nAnd all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you\nMusic rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you\nThen you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues\nBlame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks\nBlame it on everybody except for your own race\nBlame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids\nAnd just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president\nBunch of class clowns\nNiggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down\nHow dare you try to make demands for this money?\nYou gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger\nI'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war\nI heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?\nY'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more\nIt's like you wanna be so famous\nYou'll do anything for attention and a little payment\nI can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers\nPants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?\nPull your fuckin' pants up, nigga\nPut that suit back on, take that durag off\nTake that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff\nAnd then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?\nI'm not racist\nIt's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors\nI'm not racist\nBut there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours\nI wish that I knew yours\nI'm not racist, I swear\n\n\nWith all disrespect\nI don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at\nScreaming, \"All Lives Matter,\" is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?\nAnd that's one war you'll never win\nThe power in the word, \"Nigga,\" is a different sin\nWe shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is\nBut that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends\nNigga\nThat word was originated for you to keep us under\nAnd when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other\nAnd when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under\nAnd even if I wasn't picking cotton physically\nThat don't mean I'm not affected by the history\nMy grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me\nAnd you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga\nI'm sorry, you can never feel my life\nTryna have faith, but I never felt alright\nIt's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites\nJudging me by my skin color and my blackness\nTryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet\nNow I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet\nYou crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics\nDon't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes\nWhen I ain't making no dough\nYou think you know everything, but you don't\nYou wanna copy our slang and everything that we know\nTry to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah\nFuck, I'm exhausted\nI can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit\nI'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit\nAll you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with\nAnd you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you\nYou don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue\nYou don't know about the two-step or no loose change\nYou don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know\nAnd even though Barack was half as black\nYou hated President Obama, I know that's a fact\nYou couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back\nAnd then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that\nI'm not racist, I never lied\nBut I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines\nYeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god\nHe was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga\nAnd all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you\nHatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you\nAnd then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue\nBlame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ\nBlame it on everybody except for your own race\nBlame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens\nAim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but\nI might be any day now\nTreatin' everybody how you want and any way how\nI swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now\nAnd now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit\nYou know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it\nWhen Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest\n'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us\nI'm not racist, but I cry a lot\nYou don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot\nYou don't know what it's like to mind your business\nAnd get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not\nYou worry 'bout your life, so you take mine\nI love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time\nI wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives\nSo we could understand each other more, but that'd take time\nI'm not racist\nIt's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides\nI'm not racist\nBut there's two sides to every story and now you know mine\n\n\nCan't erase the scars with a bandage\nI'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'\nAgree to disagree, we could have an understandin'\nI'm not racist"

        "\nI went to the moped store, said \"Fuck it\"\nAnd salesman's like \"What up, what's your budget?\"\nAnd I'm like \"Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds\"\nHe said \"I got the one for you, follow me\"\nOoh, it's too real\nChromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield\nBanana seat, a canopy on two wheels\nEight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal\nI'm headed...\n\n\nDowntown, cruising through the alley\nTip-toeing in the street like ballet\nPulled up, moped to the valet\nWhite walls on the wheels like mayonnaise\nDope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels\nGot gas in the tank, cash in the bank\nAnd a bad little mama with her ass in my face\nI'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat\nSnuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband\nDope\n\n\nKilling the game, 'bout to catch a body\nPassed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati\nTimbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman\nGoddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis\nBut I'ma keep it hella 1987\nHead into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki\nI'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi\nI'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete\nMy seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather\nBut girl, we could still ride together, oh\nYou don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab\nFuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man\nShe got 1988 Mariah Carey hair\nVery rare, mom jeans on her derriere\nThrowing up the West Side as we tear in the air\nStop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player\n\n\nDowntown, downtown (Downtown)\nDowntown, downtown (Downtown)\nShe has her arms around your waist\nWith a balance that will keep her safe (Downtown)\nHave you ever felt the warm embrace (Downtown)\nOf a leather seat between your legs\nHey, hey-oh-ey-ey\nHey, hey-oh-ey-ey\nHey, hey-oh-ey-ey\nHey, hey-oh-ey-ey\n\n\nDowntown\nYou don't want no beef, boy\nKnow I run the streets, boy\nBetter follow me towards\nDowntown\nWhat you see is what you get, girl\nDon't ever forget, girl\nAin't seen nothing yet until you're\nDowntown\n\n\nDope\nCut the bullshit, get off my mullet\nStone washed, so raw, moped like a bullet, oh, yee-ow\nYou can't catch me, a po-po can't reprimand me\nI'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing\nI got your girl on the back going tandem\nCause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick\nWhole downtown yelling out \"Who that is?\"\n\n\nIt's me, the M, the A-C, the K\nSounding like a French pimp from back in the day\nI take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate\nI mean, water ski, ollie, ollie, oxen free\nI'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me\nI do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat\nWell hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free\nNow do you or do you not wanna ride with me?\nI got one girl, I got two wheels\nShe a big girl, but ain't a big deal\nI like a big girl, I like 'em sassy\nGoing down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet\nRunning around the whole town\nNeighbors yelling at me like, \"You need to slow down\"\n\"Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out\nMow your damn lawn and sit the hell down\"\nIf I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you\nCruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view\nThere's layers to this shit, player, tiramisu, tiramisu\nLet my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit\n\n\nDowntown, downtown (Downtown)\nDowntown, downtown\nShe has her arms around your waist\nWith a balance that will keep her safe\nHave you ever felt the warm embrace\nOf a leather seat between your legs\n\n\nDowntown\nYou don't want no beef, boy\nKnow I run the streets, boy\nBetter follow me towards\nDowntown\nWhat you see is what you get, girl\nDon't ever forget, girl\nAin't seen nothing yet until you're\nDowntown\n\n\nYou don't want no beef, boy\nKnow I run the streets, boy\nBetter follow me towards\nDowntown\nWhat you see is what you get, girl\nDon't ever forget, girl\nAin't seen nothing yet until you're\nDowntown"

        "Grass stains all on my blue jeans\nThey used to be new jeans\nBut now they\u2019re all fucked\n\nHeartbreak\nSummer\u2019s gone and so is she\nThe only one left I know is me\nBut I still feel fucked\n\nPizza box\nWedding ring left amongst the crust\nRemember when your wedding ring began to rust\nAnd the Mona Lisa wasn\u2019t real\n\n2 PM\nWhy's Madonna on the radio?\nAnd where on Earth did my baby go\nWell was she ever even mine\nWas she ever even mine\n\nSo I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re tired\nAnd you don\u2019t wanna leave\nBut girl, I can\u2019t stop your crying\nIt\u2019s a shame that you can\u2019t see\nIt\u2019s all here for you\nIt\u2019s all here for you\n\nI heard she hates her dad\nEven though he bought her that Mercedes-Benz\nShe likes to stay alone\nAnd do drugs with her friends\nPass out in the afternoon\nAnd wake up next to them\nShe needs to know herself\nBefore she falls in love again\nWoah, woah\n\nSwimming pools\nRich youth and being cool\nWe didn\u2019t learn a single thing in school\nBut daddy already paid\n\nWhip the Benz\nPedal to the floor in your new heels\nWish you could know just how happiness feels\nBut at least you\u2019re all alone\nBut at least you\u2019re all alone\nFor fuck's sake"

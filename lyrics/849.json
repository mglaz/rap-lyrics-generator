        "\nThis what you really want, huh?\nTurn me up, Ali\n\n\nI know your image of me\nIs what I hope to be\n\n\nBlack lip bastard, pass me your password\nSo I can hack inside your brain\nSee, I too have gone insane\nBefore I fall I'm sure to curse you all in Jesus' name\nLead shower, Anna Peebles hour, bitch stand the rain\nThis what y'all really want\nLet me get it back Ali\nWhen we do- when we do interviews, don't ask me 'bout no movements\nYeah I'm good\nNo crews, no-no posses, no cliques\nIf it ain't 'bout TDE I don't wanna hear that shit, bitch\nLook inside my parkin' garage and see a collage\nOf every person I despised since the moment I turned five\nCalculate my steps and strategically took my time\nEven fallin' off, I land on the ass of Nicki Minaj (so soft)\nEat that pink pussy like it's Friday\nBust one, roam and reload, then smoke to Sade\nAnd somebody tell Rihanna too\nI need that vagina too (hey baby)\nDon't fuckin' take me for some kind of fool\nI'm kinda the reminder of knowin' Compton ain't kinda cool\nGood kid, mad city, mountaintops couldn't see my views\nCountertops, we hop over, hit the register, then we move\nI hope this shit can register on a regular soon\nBefore I climb this pedestal\nAnd make you catch my fuckin' stool (bitch)\nK.Dot, leave 'em grievin' on evenin' news\nEven when society break even, I'll break rules\n\n\nI told niggas, caught wrecked, then I towed niggas\nFold niggas like clothes and drawers, nigga\nHomie chose to go toe-to-toe, I had to break his leg\nLike a clich\u00e9 to rock a show, is that over your head?\nNiggas stretchin' the truth like they choose to do yoga instead\nEither that or they depressed, eatin' yogurt in bed\nSolar system, grab a space shuttle and stay subtle\nThe bass bit the bait, I'm straight, you a gay couple\nI ain't thirsty for the deal, wait and make 'em pay double\nI'm anxious, when the bacon on the table, I need a muzzle\nYou're basic like cable to a satellite dish\nYou was runnin' L.A., now you out of there like Fish\nWhat more can I say? I'm a bastard with black lips\nBlack shirt, black shades, long black dick\nI'm awkward, dog, I'm tryna bargain shop at Saks Fifth\nSwung two axes and knocked the Earth off axis, ask 'em\n\n\nAnd all we do is it, all we do is do it\nAll we do is do it, all we do is do it (nigga squad)\n(This what you really want)\nAll we do is do it\nAnd all we do is it, all we do is do it\nAll we do is do it, all we do is do it (nigga squad)\n(This what you want, I give up\nLet Puff Daddy talk to you\nThe real Puff Daddy)\n\n\nFigg side, black nine, black lips, smoke time\nFuck this rap shit, I'm active\nSuckin' on titties since I was eight\nHoodie with my shades, I ain't tryna be fake\nSo don't be talkin' to me, pussy\nRunnin' your gums like you be Loc'ing\nWhen the world know that you're nookie\nRookie, softer than infant fabric, I won't have it\nWhen the gun drawn, get rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tatted\nKnow my niggas movin'\nYou hesitatin' to hit the lick, what the fuck is you doin'?\n\n\nPerpetratin', bitches poppin' Percocet and percolatin'\nFreelance for God but do the work of Satan\nWhatever works\nI'm clever with the words if you haven't noticed yet\nLightyears ahead, I'm bright and I like to get oral sex\nSoul brother number one plus one\nGettin' fed like where drugs and guns come from\n\n\nAll we do is do it, shittin' on the competition\nTakin' heads off, this Hannibal Lecter music\nYou niggas don't move me, you niggas just movies\nCut straight to them credits and hit you with a Uzi\nPeel off in a dullies, truck bed full of toolies\nGet home, smoke, poke on some coochie\nI'm just fuckin' around, enough with them fairy tales\nBut I bust heads for real, go 'head\u2014\nI'm Jay Rock, you lil' niggas beneath me\nHow you gon' dance with the devil with two left feet?\nPeep, thinkin' you sweet, but you weak\nTalkin' out of turn'll leave all of your teeth in the street\nMama taught you better, never clash with a giant\nUnless you David, remember, my nigga, I'm not Goliath\nFeel the wrath of this titan\nHit some water, call it Poseidon\nWig out, then hit your ass with a trident\nMoney on the table my nigga, you know I'm all in\nIf rap was a drink, you wine, nigga I'm all gin\nHundred proof, recruit a hundred troops who love to shoot\nNo fluke, my nigga, you know that's what us hunters do\nEast side up, Watts City mayhem\nChoppers, they sprayin' from AM to PM\nI'm the silent assassin of the four-headed dragon\nBlack Hippy blastin' a .50 out the back of the Benz Wagon\nToe-taggin' wack rappers off G.P\nYou can't see me, your vision ain't 3D\nYou smokin' on that seaweed, we rollin' up that kiwi\nAnd the Backwood lighted, we high for like three weeks\nYou payin' for that pussy, but we always get freebies\nTop Dawg that ho and throw it like a frisbee, it's history\nYou know the night and day is ours\nTop Dawg conglomerate, Hiii Power, bitch\n\n\nIs this what y'all really want?\nThis Black Hippy shit what y'all really want?\nWhen I'm in interviews, don't ask me 'bout no crews\nNo posses, no cliques, don't tell me who's gettin' it\nI don't give a fuck, nigga\nI just paid\u2014 I just paid six figures in taxes, nigga\nOff Section.80, on some independent shit\nUncle Sam talkin' 'bout, \"you an old lost relative,\" nigga fuck you\nK-Dot said it, not Kendrick\nAb-Soul the rawest motherfucker on the planet, nigga\nT.D.E., solar system, Control System, beyotch"

        "\nRiding through the city with the windows down\nHeard that you was talking 'bout him right there\nBoy I swear to god you better switch pronouns\nI don't ride waves, I don't switch no sound\nI don't hang ten, I'm ten toes down\nHad a little song I was gonna put first but boy, god damn, this an intro now\nRight back to it never left though\nExcept for that week I had strep throat\nKnow this shit boom when we come down south and I had to bring my own Lil Metro\n2for's on it, man the kid psychotic\nIf you looking for the flows or the hits, I got it\nWhen the sun goes down I'ma creep up on it\nLike a thief in the night, finna pick your pockets\nI ain't really fucking with you hypebeasts (nah)\nReally though, I put it on everything (everything)\nI don't really be in no shindigs\nI ain't been happy since 13\nCyHi told me how to deal with the writer's block\nGot me thinking maybe I was thinking inside the box\nNow we in the house, finna bring it around the block\nKnow they wanna hang, but we hanging them out to dry (woo, woo, woo)\nGuess he never seen this shit coming\nShe a little older, didn't think she be coming\nOnly thing I'm trying to do is keep this shit jumping\nSo I turned this motherfucker to a pole vault\nChicken finger plate for the road, dog\nHeard that you was working on a mixtape\nReally you can keep it like the coleslaw\nBring the beat back like the overalls\nYour boyfriend a tool, that's a Kobalt\nWhen I'm in the booth, make the snow fall\nAin't nobody in my class, check the role call\nOne name on it, bring the beat to me I'ma come skate on it\nSomething like Timmy, I'ma Wuntayk on it\nBoy, I know this shit's hot, no one takes on it\nPre-Med shorty, turn me on like she hit the reset on me\nTold me that we living different lives right now\nWhen I graduated, it was recess for me\nAll these frat boys won't fuck with the boy\nEven when it's really something they could come to enjoy\nShe don't listen to the lyrics, but she fuck with my voice\nI got one-hundred situations that I want to exploit and I'ma do it\nThat's right, riding through the city on my\nLast life, know I had to beat it down\nLast night, when she leave the crib she get\nBaptized, every time\nFunny how it all works out\nRight before I did this, I was feeling burnt out\nNow the whole city 'bout to get burnt down"

(Yes indeed!)\nI'ma throw shade if I can't get paid\nBlow you up to your girl like the Army grenade\nYou can slide on my ice like the Escapade\nAnd itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade\nWho me? Not you, oh yes, who's he?\nI even dig yo' man's style, but I love yo' profile\nWhisper in your ear and get you all shook up\nBut don't blush, just keep this on the hush\n\n\nI know you seen me on the video (true)\nI know you heard me on the radio (true)\nBut you still don't pay me no attention\nListenin' to what your girlfriends mention\nHe's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak\nGot a different girl every day of the week\nIt's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you\nI had to let you know that I got a crush on you\n\n\nWhile you tryin' to catch Sea Breeze, I'm in the PV's\nAll chrome D3's, decked out TV's\nCD's with crazy bass, keep my lady laced\nDon't be fooled by the baby face\nI hope ya not, 'cause your thighs got me hot\nOnly one plan, that's to rise to the top\nI told you before, when I first pursued\nI want a interlude, in the nude\n\n\nYou know I love the way you feel-a, sip my tequil-a\nWorks from the dealers, full-length chinchilla\nHeat up the clutch, seven-fifty deluxe\nThen we speed down the hutch, breakin' trees in the dutch\nI'm not the one you sleep wit', to eat quick\nWant a cheap trick, better go down to FreakNik\nYou got to hit me off, buy this girl gifts of course\nSo I look sick in my six with my Christian LaCroix\n\n\nI know you seen me on the video (true)\nI know you heard me on the radio (true)\nBut you still don't pay me no attention\nListenin' to what your girlfriends mention\nHe's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak\nGot a different girl every day of the week\nIt's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you\nI had to let you know that I got a crush on you\nI know you seen me on the video (true)\nI know you heard me on the radio (true)\nBut you still don't pay me no attention\nListenin' to what your girlfriends mention\nHe's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak\nGot a different girl every day of the week\nIt's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you\nI had to let you know that I got a crush on you\nI know you seen me on the video (true)\nI know you heard me on the radio (true)\nBut you still don't pay me no attention\nListenin' to what your girlfriends mention\nHe's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak\nGot a different girl every day of the week\nIt's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you\nI had to let you know that I got a crush on you\nI know you seen me on the video (true)\nI know you heard me on the radio (true)\nBut you still don't pay me no attention\nListenin' to what your girlfriends mention\nHe's a slut, he's a ho, he's a freak\nGot a different girl every day of the week\nIt's cool, not tryin' to put a rush on you\nI had to let you know that I got a crush on you"

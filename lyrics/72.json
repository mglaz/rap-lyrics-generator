        "\nIt may not mean nothin' to y'all\nBut understand, nothin' was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stoppin' at all\nI want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane\nI'm shuttin' shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even plannin' to call\nI want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane\n\n\nLast name Ever, first name Greatest\nLike a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with\nStarted off local, but thanks to all the haters\nI know G-IV pilots on a first name basis\nIn your city, faded off the brown, Nino\nShe insist she got more class, we know\nSwimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo\nIf I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo\nDropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album\nWho'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?\nLabels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm\nEverybody got a deal, I did it without one\nYeah, nigga, I'm about my business\nKillin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list\nEveryone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness\nIf you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches\n\n\nIt may not mean nothin' to y'all\nBut understand, nothin' was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stoppin' at all\nI want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane\nI'm shuttin' shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even plannin' to call\nI want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane\n\n\nEver-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'\nAin't no question who about to kill 'em\nI used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains\nI stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came\nAnd went hard all fall like the ball teams\nJust so I can make it rain all spring\nY'all seen my story, my glory\nI had raped the game young, you can call it statutory\nWhen a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me\nOld money, Benjamin Button, \"What?\" nothin'\nNow it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin\nYou would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband\nYou would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't\nLike they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't\nUm, you're such a fuckin' loser\nHe ain't even go to class, Bueller\nTrade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back\nRemember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?\nChasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac\nAll the way in Hollywood and I can't even act\nThey pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap\nI used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back\n\n\nIt may not mean nothin' to y'all\nBut understand, nothin' was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stoppin' at all\nI want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane\nI'm shuttin' shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even plannin' to call\nI want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane\n\n\nOkay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans\nI want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden\nFresher than the harvest, step up to the target\nIf I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans\nAnd I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops\nHop up in my car and told my chauffeur, \"To the top\"\nLife is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops\nBut what should I scream for? This is my theme park\nMy mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark\nPistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk\nLet the king talk, check the price and pay attention\nLil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention\nI'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer\nI'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover\nShh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas\nNo brake pads, no such thing as last, uh\n\n\nIt may not mean nothin' to y'all\nBut understand, nothin' was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stoppin' at all\nI want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane\nI'm shuttin' shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even plannin' to call\nI want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane\n\n\nThere they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow\nNuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa\nHe can make them look like bozos\nHe's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no\nGo for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no\nHe ain't had him a buzz like this\nSince the last time that he overdosed\nThey been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose\nBack into the game and they know\nRap will never be the same as befo'\nBashin' in the brains of these hoes\nAnd establishin' a name as he goes\nThe passion in the flame is ignited\nYou can't put it out once we light it\nThis shit is exactly what the fuck\nThat I'm talkin' about when we riot\nYou dealin' with a few true villains\nWho stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'\nAnd spit true feelings until our tooth fillings\nCome flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it\nPayback, motherfucker\nFor the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?\nWhen I slap the taste outta your mouth\nWith the bass so loud that it shakes the place\nI'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face\nYou ain't gonna have no face to save\nBy the time I'm through with this place, so Drake\n\n\nIt may not mean nothin' to y'all\nBut understand, nothin' was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stoppin' at all\nI want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane\nI'm shuttin' shit down in the mall\nAnd tellin' every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even plannin' to call\nI want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane"

        "\nBitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks\n\n\nBitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks\nLick on these nuts and suck the dick\nGets the fuck out after you're done\nThen I hops in my ride to make a quick run\nBitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks\nLick on these nuts and suck the dick\nGets the fuck out after you're done\nThen I hops in my ride to make a quick run\n\n\nI used to know a bitch named Eric Wright\nWe used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night\nTighter than a motherfucka with the gangsta beats\nAnd we was balling on the motherfucking Compton streets\nPeep, the shit got deep and it was on\nNumber 1 song after number 1 song\nLong as my motherfucking pockets was fat\nI didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at\nBut she was hanging with a white bitch doing the shit she do\nSucking on his dick just to get a buck or two\nAnd the few ends she got didn't mean nothing\nNow she's suing cause the shit she be doing ain't shit\nBitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short\nSo now she's taking me to court\nIt's real conversation for your ass\nSo recognize, and pass to Daz\n\n\nNow as I'm rolling with my nigga Dre and Eastwood\nFucking hoes, clocking dough, up to no good\nWe flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks\n(Snoop: But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that\nThis is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow\nYou run up in them hoes and grab the cash\nAnd get your dash on\nWhile you're chilling with your homies and shit\nAnd how my niggas kick the anthem like this\n(Biatch)\n\n\nBitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks\nLick on these nuts and suck the dick\nGets the fuck out after you're done\nThen I hops in my ride to make a quick run\n\n\nTo the store, to get me a 4-0\nSnoop Doggy-Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes\nSo I head down the street to Long Beach\nJust so I could meet a freak\nTo lick me from my head to my feet\nAnd I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up\nNothing but homies around, so I puts my gun up\nBitches on my nuts like clothes\nBut I'm from Tha Pound and \"we don't love them hoes\"\nHow could you trust a ho? (Snoop: Why?)\nCause a ho's a trick\nWe don't love them tricks (Snoop: Why?)\nCause a trick's a bitch\nAnd my dick's constantly in her mouth\nTurning them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now\n\n\nI once had a bitch named Annie Mae\nUsed to be all in them guts like every day\nThe pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung\nI was in love like a motherfucka, licking the pearl tongue\nThe homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good\nBut I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood\nSo I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine\nGuess what? Got gaffled by one-time\nI'm back to the motherfucking county jail\n6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail\nI gets released on a hot sunny day\nMy nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre\nScoop in a coupe, \"Snoop we got news\nYour girl was tricking while you was draped in your county blues\"\nI ain't been out a second\nAnd already gotta do some motherfucking chin-checkin'\nMove up the block as we groove up the block\nSee my girl's house, \"Dre, pass the Glock\"\nKick in the do', I look on the flo'\nIt's my little cousin Daz and he's fucking my ho, yo\n(Bitches ain't shit)\nI un-cock my shit\nI'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed\nMan, fuck a bitch\n\n\nBitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks\nLick on these nuts and suck the dick\nGets the fuck out after you're done\nThen I hops in my ride to make a quick run\nBitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks\nLick on these nuts and suck the dick\nGets the fuck out after you're done\nThen I hops in my ride to make a quick run\nBitches ain't shit\n\n\nI don't give a fuck about a bitch\nBut I and her know that they can't fade this\nCause I'm doin my own thing down with the swang\nI'm hanging with Death Row like it ain't no thang\nI say you know you can't deal, cause I'm a bitch that's real\nMotherfuckers need to step back, hell yeah they need to chill\nBecause I don't give a fuck, and I don't give a fuck\nAnd I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck\nAnd now I gotta do some shit that's clean\nBut when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah\nLike a washing machine I can wash the clothes\nAll the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', ho\nBut they can't hang with my type of swang\nI ain't trying to say I suck every ding-a-lang\nBut just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue\nAnd then they're sprung, and with the nuts hung\n\n\nBitches ain't shit"

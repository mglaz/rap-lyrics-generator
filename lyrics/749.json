        "\n\n\nWe are lovers through and through\nAnd though we made it through the storm\nI really want you to realize, I really want to put you on\nI\u2019ve been searching for someone to satisfy my every need\nWon\u2019t you be my inspiration?\nBe the real love that I need\n\n\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\n\n\nOoh, when I met you\nI just knew that you would take my heart and run\nUntil you told me how you loved for me, you said I\u2019m not the one\nSo I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of\nAnd now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love\n\n\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nI got to have a real love\n\n\nLove so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true\nI thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind\nBut it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I\u2019ll find\nA real love\n\n\nSo I\u2019ve tried my best and prayed to God he\u2019ll send me someone real\nTo caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel\nNow I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all\nIll give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall\n\n\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love (Real love, real love)\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\n\n\nSee, I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go\n(Real love, I\u2019m searching for a real love)\nBeen around the world and high and low and still I never know\n(Someone to set my heart free\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love)\nHow it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around\nGotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found\n\n\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nSomeone to set my heart free\nReal love, I\u2019m searching for a real love\nReal love"

        "Look don't worry bout anything they told you\nRemember what she SAID about winter and what the cold do\nEverything's a season and some things you gotta go through\nBelieve me I don' seen it all, you're young talking to the old you\nWhen haters come around look em down tell em \u201cwe don't owe you\u201d\nYou gon lose some friends but those circles are better than the ovals\nA black man left the oval\nKeep that style you got soulful\nThe best of the best gon fear you\nSky's the limit see, I told you\nYou gon be the difference between McDonald's, Burger King and Whole Foods\nDo your thang and slip thru ib em they ain't gon have no clue\nYou won\u2019t need no toll booths, they'll pay attention, Hov do\nThey'll ask you for advice tell em the same thing i told you\nShould be a crime to be this fly and awesome\nAnd to think love is all it cost em\nFeel like Jordan this the ball that Pippen tossed em\nI'm the underdog and gold is what flossin\u2019\nWhen they told me my chances of losing was higher than divorces\nYou gotta know your worth and work \u2018cus I can't force ya\nGrowing up I shopped at Kmart and Ross\u2019, celebrated every win\nAnd learned to learn from all my losses\nI never signed paperwork without reading the clauses\nMy parents worked way too hard to not get no credit for it\nI'm a trip like Grayson Allen\nY'all never made me VALID\nI learn that from Phylicia Rashad and Debbie Allen\nI'm the other one them another ones screaming like Khaled\nWe don't match up, ask my stylist\nI rock Nike and New Balance\nI drink water by gallons, y'all should call me captain\nI was told to be the flow and not follow it while y\u2019all actin\u2019\nI'm the better version of what you used to think and call talent\nI been bankin, check my balance\nYou a bet away from skidrow\nI owe Sallie Mae but owe my people way mo\u2019\nGod rested on the seventh day\nAnd worked on me on day fo\u2019\n\nI\u2019ve been killing for a long time\nMy lawyers gotta caseload\nI cracked the code, it's no longer safe for y'all\nKujo still the scariest of all the dogs\nAfter that come all my dawgs\nTalent level\u2019s thru the walls\nI'm Juggernaut, riding wit my car doh\u2019 locked\nCoppers known to hang out on these kinda blocks\nDon\u2019t get shot!\nThey say we 3/5ths human, well the rest of me\u2019s an autobot\nI\u2019m really hot\nYou should ask my team and dem\nJamla\u2019s still the squad and my confidence is thru the roof\nI appreciate the compliments\nLaila\u2019s Wisdom, rest in peace. I love you dear\n\nYo, we good over here, here (here)\nWe good over here here (here)\nYeah, we good over here here uh\nYo, we good over here, here (here)\nWe good over here here (here)\nYeah, we good over here here uh"

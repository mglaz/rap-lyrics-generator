        "\nYo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?\nYo, shouts out to Ty Dollas\nShouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle\nShouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean\nShouts out to Syd the Dude\nShouts out to L-Boy, awwwwk\nI told you\n\n\nThe big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners\nIn a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages\nTossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches\nSo when he says, \"Catch up, nigga,\" it looks like an accident\nUm, flowing like my pad is the maxiest\nMy bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda\nIt's the dark skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada\nThen kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela\nPut her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain\nI never had a Reason, nigga, I was just Ableton\nNot a fucking Logic-contradicting dickhead (Not a Logic)\nFlyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit\nSemen-scented cheetah printed tee\nIn that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season\nPrevious items in the present\nWith the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team\nIt's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang see, he did come back, though)\n\n\nTo have some type of knowledge that is one perception\nBut knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus\nI'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless\nSmiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses\nChildren who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'\nI'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood\nWhips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims\nCoke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot\nAnd salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop\nIt's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop\nAnd out my Kool-Aid, Juice\n\n\nWhat's up, bitch?\nHodgy got the juice, I got the gin\nJasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in\nWolf Gang party at the hotel\nI call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell\nYou know Left Brain need a freak (Yeah)\nI need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat\nYup, uh, and her ass fat\nDon't be surprised if I ask where the hash at\nNigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher (What up, what up, what's up, smoke)\nDomo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter\nStill bang salute me or just shoot me\n'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting\nYeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack\nThe king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac\nWe like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up\nAnd if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct\nFree my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much\nBut two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus\n\n\n(We out here)\nWhat the fuck is caution?\nOften I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins\nLost in translation, the dreams you chase\nGot you diving for the plates like you stealing home base\nThat's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones\nWith Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on\nAnd Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp\nThree lettermans that Ace has been making him\nNo strays while we catching matinees, huh?\nI'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days\nI had the top off the GT3 like toupees\nOne finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays\nMy grand scheme of things is to be attached\nTo the game like bitches to their wedding rings\nAnd you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene\nIn the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining\nLike the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem\nIf you say, \"Get 'em, Mike G,\" then I got 'em\nOne man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem\nFrom Briggs, I got bars and plans to\nPimp these Polish bitches into pop stars\nHumanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still\nAnd if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real\nOF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh\n\n\nIt's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped\nWith my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not\nKnow your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop\nBitch, I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock\nI've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot\nBig wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks\nNow I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz\nFire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop\nOp, Dom next shit in your wish list\nMad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches\nOn some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list\nAnd I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch\nOdd in your motherfuckin' area (Motherfuckin' area)\nBlood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya\n('Fore I bury ya)\nSuicide flow, let the big wave carry ya\n(Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya)\nTyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up\nAnd fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup?

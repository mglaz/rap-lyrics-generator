        "\nI'm about to lose my mind\nYou\u2019ve been gone for so long\nI\u2019m runnin' out of time\nI need a doctor, call me a doctor\nI need a doctor, doctor\nTo bring me back to life\n\n\nI told the world, one day I would pay it back\nSay it on tape, and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back\nBut I don\u2019t even know if I believe it when I\u2019m sayin' that\nDoubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so gray and black\nHope, I just need a ray of that\n\u2018Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for \u2018em\nThey just say it's wack \u2014 but they don\u2019t know what dope is\nAnd I don\u2019t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this\nAll I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest\nYou picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you\nBut for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do\nBut it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you\nIt\u2019s dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you\nI don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue\n\u2018Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick; you\nGon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic, or you\nGon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do\n\u2018Cause\u2014\n\n\nI'm about to lose my mind\nYou\u2019ve been gone for so long\nI\u2019m runnin' out of time\nI need a doctor, call me a doctor\nI need a doctor, doctor\nTo bring me back to life\n\n\nIt hurts when I see you struggle; you come to me with ideas\nYou say they're just pieces, so I\u2019m puzzled, \u2018cause the shit I hear is\nCrazy, but you're either gettin' lazy or you don\u2019t believe in you no more\nSeems like your own opinions, not one you can form\nCan't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself\nSecond guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help\nLike I\u2019m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor\nI can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are\nIt was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you\nDon't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth!\nYou risked your career for me, I know it as well as you\nNobody wanted to fuck with the white boy\nDre, I\u2019m cryin' in this booth\nYou saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours\nBut I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more\nBut I ain't givin' up faith\nAnd you ain't givin' up on me \u2014 get up, Dre!\nI'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck\u2019s sake! \u2018Cause\u2014\n\n\nI'm about to lose my mind\nYou\u2019ve been gone for so long\nI\u2019m runnin' out of time\nI need a doctor, call me a doctor\nI need a doctor, doctor\nTo bring me back to life\nBring me back to life\nBring me back to life\nI need a doctor, doctor\nTo bring me back to life\n\n\nIt literally feels like a lifetime ago\nBut I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though\nYou walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes\nOnce you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke\nWent through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left\nThey said they was ridin' to the death\nBut where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?\nI don't see none of them, all I see is Slim\nFuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him\nFuckin' backstabbers!\nWhen the chips were down you just laughed at us\nNow you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!\nYou gon' see us in our lab jackets\nAnd ask us where the fuck we been?\nYou can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!\nAnd the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat\nMakin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards!\nOne more CD and then I\u2019m packin' up my bags, and as\nI\u2019m leavin', I\u2019ll guarantee they'll scream:\n\"Dre, don\u2019t leave us like that, man!\" \u2018cause\u2014\n\n\nI'm about to lose my mind\nYou\u2019ve been gone for so long\nI\u2019m runnin' outta time\nI need a doctor, call me a doctor\nI need a doctor, doctor\nTo bring me back to life"

        "\nYo D, what? Come on (Yeah)\nWhat? What? Come on (Yeah)\n\n\n\"Give me the fortune, keep the fame\" said my man Louis\nI agreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie\nI asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye\nHe looked at me, he thought about it, was like, \"I'm clueless, why?\"\nThe question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible\nOur morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow\nAnd so tomorrow coming later than usual\nWaiting on someone to pity us\nWhile we find the beauty in the hideous\nThey say money's the root of all evil, but I can't tell\nYou know what I mean, pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells\nDollar bills, or is it the mindstate that's ill?\nCreating crime rates to fill the new prisons they build\nOver money and religion, there's more blood to spill\nThe wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal\nWhat's the deal?\nA lot of cats who buy records are straight broke\nBut my language universal, they be reciting my quotes\nWhile R&B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat of thought\nThat my man Louis' statements just provoked\nCaught up, in conversations of our personal worth\nBrought up, through endangered species status on the planet Earth\nSurvival tactics means, busting gats to prove you hard\nYour firearms are too short to box with God\nWithout faith, all of that is illusionary\nRaise my son, no vindication of manhood necessary\n\n\nNot strong (Only aggressive), not free (We only licensed)\nNot compassionate, only polite (Now who the nicest?)\nNot good, but well behaved\n(Chasing after death so we can call ourselves brave?)\nStill living like mental slaves\nHiding like thieves in the night from life\nIllusions of oasis making you look twice\nHiding like thieves in the night from life\nIllusions of oasis making you look twice\n\n\nYo, I'm sure that everybody out listening agree\nThat everything you see ain't really how it be\nA lot of jokers out running in place, chasing the style\nBe a lot going on beneath the empty smile\nMost cats in my area be loving the hysteria\nSynthesized surface conceals the interior\nAmerica, land of opportunity\nMirages and camouflages, more than usually\nSpeaking loudly, saying nothing, you confusing me, you losing me\nYour game is twisted, want me enlisted in your usury\nFoolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly\nBuffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception\nReflection rarely seen across the surface of the looking glass\nWalking the street, wondering who they be looking past\nLooking gassed with them imported designer shades on\nStars shine bright, but the light rarely stays on\nSame song, just remixed, different arrangement\nPut you on a yacht, but they won't call it a slave ship\nStrangeness, you don't control this, you barely hold this\nScreaming \"brand new\", when they just sanitized the old shit\nSuppose it's, just another clever Jedi mind trick\nThat they been running across stars through all the time with\nI find it's distressing, there's never no in-between\n(We either niggas or Kings, we either bitches or Queens)\nThe deadly ritual seems immersed in the perverse\nFull of short attention spans, short tempers, and (short skirts)\nLong barrel automatics released in (short bursts)\nThe length of black life is treated with (short worth)\nGet yours first, them other niggas secondary\nThat type of illing that be filling up the cemetery\nThis life is temporary, but the (soul is eternal)\nSeparate the real from the lie, let me learn you\n(Not strong), only aggressive 'cause the power ain't directed\nThat's why we are subjected to the will of the oppressive\n(Not free), we only licensed, not live, we just exciting\n'Cause (the captors) own (the masters to what we writing)\nNot compassionate, only polite, (we well trained)\nOur sincerity's rehearsed in stage, (it's just a game)\nNot good, but well behaved, 'cause the cameras survey\n(Most of the things that we think, do or say)\nWe chasing after death just to call ourselves brave\nBut everyday, (next man meet with the grave)\nI give a damn if any fan (recall my legacy)\n(I'm trying to live life in the sight of God's memory)\n(Like that) y'all\n\n\nA lot of people don't understand the true criteria of things\nCan't just accept the appearance, have to get the true essence\n(They ain't looking around)\n\n\nNot strong (Only aggressive), not free (We only licensed)\nNot compassionate, only polite (Now who the nicest?)\nNot good, but well behaved\n(Chasing after death so we can call ourselves brave?)\nStill living like mental slaves\nHiding like thieves in the night from life\nIllusions of oasis making you look twice\nHiding like thieves in the night from life\nIllusions of oasis making you look twice\nHiding like thieves in the night from life\nIllusions of oasis making you look twice\nHiding like thieves in the night from life\nIllusions of oasis making you look twice\n\n\nStop hiding, stop hiding\nStop hiding yo' face (yes, c'mon)\nStop hiding, stop hiding (celebrating death)\n'Cause ain't no hiding place\nStop hiding, stop hiding\nStop hiding yo' face\nStop hiding, stop hiding\n'Cause ain't no hiding place\n(Not strong\nNot free\nNot compassionate\nWe well trained\nBlack Star)\n\n(Ad libs to fade)\nBlack Star keep shining\nWe take the Black Star line right on home"

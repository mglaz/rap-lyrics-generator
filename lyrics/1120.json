        "\nI don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow\nFor you\nI gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle\nI'll pour you up, we'll work on us\nCause ain't nobody taking my baby\nI wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here\nCause ain't nobody takin' my baby\n\n\nYour heart weighs a ton\nGirl watch me heavy lift\nHow many more times we gon' argue over petty shit\nI mess up but shit you mess up too\nThe way you answer makes me question you\nI guess your body ain't the only thing that's flexible\nYou bend the truth, we lettin' loose, verbal warfare\nOpen wounds we still poke even tho we know it's sore there\nCause hurt people hurt people, that's a known fact\nYou got me tempted to say fuck it where my hoes at\nBut I know that they don't last, that's why I don't go back\nI stay put I want you, I don't care I want you\n\n\nI don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow\nFor you\nI gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle\nI'll pour you up, we'll work on us\nCause ain't nobody taking my baby\nI wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here\nCause ain't nobody takin' my baby\n\n\nIt was me and you in love for a quick summer\nNow we textin' question marks cause we switched numbers\nLookin' back you were the perfect fit\nDidn't let me fuck right away you made me work for it\nUse to ride around drunk you brought out the worst in me\nDamn I went to jail with you and that was a first for me\nHeaven knows that I was hell bent\nFirst time we said we love each other was through cell vents\nGuess I should've known then\nBut I'm stubborn I'll admit that\nAt least I got some classic rap songs from your mishaps\nShit I ain't perfect though, I stayed what's wrong with me\nI'm in love with challenges, girl that's just honesty\nNo matter what tho I stayed put\nTill it wasn't funny anymore like Dane cook\nOut of sync out of touch, I should probably give it up but\nI'm a lover not a fighter but I'll fight for what I love\n\n\nI don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow\nFor you\nI gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle\nI'll pour you up, we'll work on us\nCause ain't nobody taking my baby\nI wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here\nCause ain't nobody takin' my baby"

        "\nUh, uh, uh, uh\nUh, uh\n\n\nDay and night\nI toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind\nI look for peace but see I don't attain\nWhat I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play\nNow look at this\nMadness the magnet keeps attracting me, me\nI try to run but see I'm not that fast\nI think I'm first but surely finish last, last\n\n\n'Cause day and night\nThe lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night\nHe's all alone through the day and night\nThe lonely loner seems to free his mind at night\nAt, at, at night\nDay and night\nThe lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night\nHe's all alone, some things will never change\nThe lonely loner seems to free his mind at night\nAt, at, at night\n\n\nHold the phone\nThe lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo\nHe's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade\nWithin his dreams he sees the life he made, made\nThe pain is deep\nA silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep\nThe girl he wants don't seem to want him too\nIt seems the feelings that she had are through, through\n\n\n'Cause day and night\nThe lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night\nHe's all alone through the day and night\nThe lonely loner seems to free his mind at night\nAt, at, at night\nDay and night\nThe lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night\nHe's all alone, some things will never change\nThe lonely loner seems to free his mind at night\nAt, at, at night\n\n\nSlow mo'\nWhen the tempo slows up and creates that new, new\nHe seems alive though he is feelin' blue\nThe sun is shinin', man he's super cool, cool\nThe lonely nights\nThey fade away, he slips into his white Nike's\nHe smokes a clip and then he's on the way\nTo free his mind in search of\nTo free his mind in search of\nTo free his mind in search of\n\n\nDay and night\nThe lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night\nHe's all alone through the day and night\nThe lonely loner seems to free his mind at night\nAt, at, at night\nDay and night\nThe lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night\nHe's all alone, some things will never change\nThe lonely loner seems to free his mind at night\nAt, at, at night, night\nAt, at, at night, night\n\n\nNa-na-na-na-na-na, Kid Cudi\nCleveland status, grind all day\nCleveland status, grind all night\nCleveland status, grind all day\nCleveland status, grind all night"

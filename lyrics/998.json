        "\nHome\nA place where I can go\nTo take this off my shoulders\nSomeone take me home\nHome\nA place where I can go\nTo take this off my shoulders\nSomeone take me home\nSomeone take me\n\n\nLook, I didn't power through the struggle\nJust to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position\nAnd interrupt the vision\nAfter everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions\nAll these miles, feet, inches\nThey can't add up to the distance\nThat I have been through, just to get to\nA place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe\nI still ache from trying to keep pace\nSomebody give me a sign, I'm starting to lose faith\n\n\nNow tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?\nHow did I lose it when I was right there?\nNow I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces\nTell me why the world never fights fair\nI'm trying to find\n\n\nHome\nA place where I can go\nTo take this off my shoulders\nSomeone take me home\nHome\nA place where I can go\nTo take this off my shoulders\nSomeone take me home\nIt's been a long time coming\nSomeone take me\n\n\nHome, ho-o-o-o-me\nHome, home\nSomeone take me\nHome, ho-o-o-o-me\nHome, home\n\n\nLook, I've been through so much pain\nAnd it's hard to maintain, any smile on my face\n'Cause there's madness on my brain\nSo I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map\nGotta follow what I'm feeling to discover where it's at\nI need the (memory)\nIn case this fate is forever, just to be sure these last days are better\nAnd if I have any (enemies)\nTo give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make it home safe\n\n\nNow tell me: how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?\nHow did I lose it when I was right there?\nNow I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces\nTell me why the world never fights fair\nI'm trying to find\n\n\nHome\nA place where I can go\nTo take this off my shoulders\nSomeone take me home\nSomeone take me\n\n\nI found no cure for the loneliness\nI found no cure for the sickness\nNothing here feels like home\nCrowded streets, but I'm all alone\nI found no cure for the loneliness\nI found no cure for the sickness\nNothing here feels like home\nCrowded streets, but I'm all alone\n\n\nSomeone take me\nHome, ho-o-o-o-me\nTake me home\nHome, home (take me home)\nSomeone take me\nHome, ho-o-o-o-me (someone, someone)\nNothing here feels like home\nHome, home\nSomeone take me"

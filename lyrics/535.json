        "\nNo matter what, ain't no cryin'\nYou don't gotta tell me it hurt\nI know it hurt\nNo cryin'\nTo lose somebody you really love and they not dead\nSuck it up and roll\nBut you dead to me\nYeah, yeah\nLove you with all my heart, I swear to God I do\nSo I forgive you, I'll never forget what you did\n\n\nI'm not a human being\nAnd I came up from nothin' just imagine that\nNow I got my own, just imagine that\nTried to take it from me, I went and got it back\nI lost day ones, just imagine that\nFeelin' like it's all on me\nSoon as they fall, they gon' call on me\nI remember when they used to talk 'bout me\nThese days now I got it all, just imagine that\n\n\nLike I remember when it wasn't nothin' with us\nNow it's retarded\nThese days now I got it all\nChoppin' game with the President, we on a call\nNow we flyin' over Bogota\nI swear that I'm flyer, it ain't no denial\nI'm drownin', yeah, we goin' up\nGot another female say she want it right now\nTold her I ain't comin', you gon' have to pipe down\nI'm in the studio, I'm on the grind right now\nLike right now\n\n\nAnd I came up from nothin' just imagine that\nNow I got my own, just imagine that\nTried to take it from me, I went and got it back\nI lost day ones, just imagine that\nFeelin' like it's all on me\nSoon as they fall, they gon' call on me\nI remember when they used to talk 'bout me\nThese days now I got it all, just imagine that\n\n\nI'm not a human being, but who do you believe?\nAll praise be to God right now, I achieve\nI've been to hell and back, now I'm seein' different things\nAnd what we sippin' on, we never said it give you wings\nI don't get tired, I'm a billionaire, what you believe\nI'm a bread winner, tell Malcolm X rest in peace\nLot of bred Japanese red stitch denim jeans\nI ain't scared of death, say you want it, yeah, we can squeeze\nYou ain't ready, yeah\nWhen I'm alone in my trap, I would stare at the wall\nListenin' to Biggie Smalls, I can't wait 'til I ball\nIt's just me and my dawg, had a couple of flaws\nI was bad at savin' money 'til a dick got a broad\nI fell off, I got it\nIn Brooks town in the bed with her lookin' at the roof\nI'm not opinionated, but I used to keep a tool\nNever had too many problems 'til I had too many partners\nRichard ever call a nigga back, he know I got him\nI put that on my body\n\n\nAnd I came up from nothin' just imagine that\nNow I got my own, just imagine that\nTried to take it from me, I went and got it back\nI lost day ones, just imagine that\nFeelin' like it's all on me\nSoon as they fall, they gon' call on me\nI remember when they used to talk 'bout me\nThese days now I got it all, just imagine that\n\n\nOpen up to tell me why you frownin' up, time flies fast\nThumbin' through the bands, countin' up\nI no longer post on Carolina, had to switch the route\nTurn the beat up, I ain't all beat in the drought\nI don't fuck with nothin' but some steppers, dope game veteran\nCocaine seller, you got raw it move better\nTwo grand, quinine, make the dog food better\nThe one take a one, threw a mil', no pressure\n\n\nAnd I came up from nothin' just imagine that\nNow I got my own, just imagine that\nTried to take it from me, I went and got it back\nI lost day ones, just imagine that\nFeelin' like it's all on me\nSoon as they fall, they gon' call on me\nI remember when they used to talk 'bout me\nThese days now I got it all, just imagine that"

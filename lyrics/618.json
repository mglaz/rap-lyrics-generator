        "\nSouthside\nIf Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you\n\n\nI got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada\nBut Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar\nI just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina\nNow I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her\nI'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger\nDamn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?\nI keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up\n'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur\nThis Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me\nI look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me\nBut you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me\nBut how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me\n\n\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now, got me talking about my life\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now and I need ya in my life\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now\n\n\nYeah, I'm both\nYeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked\nYeah, you think I need you but I don't\nJust left out Dubai with all my folk\nOpen water, my location is remote\nShout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat\nThis some shit I wrote about when I was broke\nSee, the power of the mind is not a joke\nMan, I said that I would do it and I did\nUsed to get left-overs out the fridge\nNobody was famous where I lived\n'Til I got it jumping at the crib\nTook a lot to be able to give, I mean\n\n\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now, got me talking about my life\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now and I need ya in my life\nI don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high\nBut I'm both right now\n\n\nSouthside"

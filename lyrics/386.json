        "\nI just need some time; I'm tryna think straight\nI just need a moment in my own space\nAsk me how I'm doin', I say \"okay,\" yeah\nBut ain't that what we all say?\nSometimes I think back to the old days\nIn the pointless conversations with the old me\nYeah, back when my momma used to hold me\nI wish somebody woulda told me\n\n\nIf you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain\nIf you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change\nIf you want trust, you gon' have to give some away\nIf you want love, if you want love\n\n\nYeah, as a kid I used to think life\nIs moving so slow, I watch it go by\nLook out the window on my bus ride\nI thought the world was so small, through my closed eyes\nI've always tried to control things\nIn the end that's what controls me\nMaybe that's why I'm controllin'\nI wish somebody woulda told me\n\n\nIf you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain\nIf you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change\nIf you want trust, you gon' have to give some away\nIf you want love, if you want love\n\n\nThe older I get, I feel like I'm always tryna save time\nTalkin' to the voices in my head, they make me think twice\nTellin' me it doesn't mean it's wrong because it feels right\nI'm scared that one day I'll wake up and wonder where'd the time go\nTalk about the past like it's the present while I rock slow\nI'll sit in the living room and laugh with kids of my own\nAnd tell 'em\n\n\nIf you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain\nI wish you woulda told me\nIf you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change\nI wish somebody woulda told me\nIf you want trust, you gon' have to give some away\nYou gon' have to give\nIf you want love, if you want love\nIf you want love, if you want love"

        "\nWanna sit beside a sick and seductive sinner, see\nSomething so sinister seeking sookie somethin' like a centipede\nSlitherin', she's searchin' for synergy\nSuckin' my seed, chakra tease stickin' sippin' Hennessy, shittin'\nOn the hissin' I'll spit you out of commission\nPosition the bitch and dip in when I mention slip in submission\nAll of this is to quicken the copulatin' and kissin'\nMy operation is drippin' to the bottom, shakin' and strippin'\nOdd when I bust, KOD put 'em in Necropolis\nGivin' this rod to the good broads, and they givin' they bras to us\nWith the gift to break up a couple that's monogamous\nStop with the probs and take off your effin' draws, bitch and rock with us\nBeen giddy 'cause them titties are on my chin-chinny\nChin, did he pretend he was again kiddie?\nSuckin' the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me and the skin pretty\nDim lit he, then hitting thee trim in Sin City\nLet it in, I'm the medicine, get her wetter than ever been\nNever better than a veteran, level that in the bed again\nRockin' red, I been in my letterman, bright as Edison\nLike I said I sin, head I win at events and I\u2019m fetishin'\nOpen up, you hoes, you know what's up\nTold you when I bust, her clothes they wanna just\nGo right off her butt, for sure they wanna cut\nExplode, drop a load 'cause the flow is\n\n\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)\nSo dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)\nSo dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so heroin, so cocaine\nSo ketamine, promethazine, so X (so wet)\nSo Thorazine, so morphine\nSo dope that they wanna have sex\nSo dope they wanna (fuck)\n\n\nShe said \"I heard that you was packin', I'ma fan of your rappin'\nI'm feining action, where you really from, Cape Town?\"\nI said \"Yeah bitch, and I was born in London\nSo I'm thinkin' 'bout fuckin' you with the crumpets and some cake now\"\nHow did we get so stereotypical?\nFairly so seminal now I'm flowin' to the pinnacle\nI see you got some friends who just lookin' to get it from the medic\nSo I'ma 'bout to pivot on 'em and I make rounds\nWant a piece of the beast from the East?\nComplete in the sheets, release beats, got her man down\nYour boy just never could compete with us, please better believe\nWe skeet, now wipe yourself off with a ShamWow\nMe and Nina run deeper than receivers\nI beat up all on her beaver now she wanna feed the meter!\nSpeakers bumpin' tweeters from here up into Medina\nLeave us pleasin', all your nieces screamin' \"Take Me to Your Leader\"\nI'm trainspottin' the vein rockin' the lane off and came droppin'\nSerious game all on your brain, rottin'!\nPick a million pricks and I'm pretty sure that you missed the one\nThat hits you on the clit, quick drip, I be the main option\nBlowin' the slut up just for good luck\nAnd I'm fuckin' the kitty up with the angel dust in my nuts\nTrophy lovin' cup and that dopin' is such a must\nThat it's troublesome to give up when they lust\nSo dope they wanna\n\n\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)\nSo dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)\nSo dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so heroin, so cocaine\nSo ketamine, promethazine, so X (so wet)\nSo Thorazine, so morphine\nSo dope that they wanna have sex\nSo dope they wanna (fuck)\n\n\nLovin' to get it up in it in the back of the room and make 'em scream and\nGoin' up in it deep as she was feindin\u2019 when she saw my weiner\nShe told me she ready for anything, I'm talkin' anything\nI stuck it up in her jaws, I\u2019m breakin' walls like I was Katrina\nNot even know me but she know my flow is OG\nShe told me she like to play with the pussy when she get lonely\nHomie if I was only right there instead of a Sony\nYou claimin' the pussy wet but don't tell me baby, just show me\nShe ask if I'm comin' up with the mask in my entrance\nSinner in a second, real spitter like every sentence\nShe was there for repentance, ever since I was an infant\nI'm damagin' the vagina, remind you I'm filled with vengeance\nHit 'em whenever they wanna run up and they doing it 'cause I rap and shit\nI really don't care, whatever it takes to get 'em up on the mattress\nI could have been the one that's on the run for busting a gun\nBut this is way more fun to get up in these motherfucking actresses\nIn bikinis and suckin' on my zucchini\nShe told me she wanna be me while sippin' Apple Martinis\nFuck it if I'm a meanie, she probably would never leave me\nShit I can play eenie meanie from sly and cuff on my weenie\nAnd now I see 'em whenever I hit the stage\nThey posted up in the audience, all of 'em filled with hope\nKnowin' they only wanna be in the presence\nOr get affiliated with you because you was dope\nSo dope they wanna\n\n\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)\nSo dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so dope they wanna (suck)\nSo dope they wanna (give it all up and really abrupt)\nSo dope they wanna (fuck) so heroin, so cocaine\nSo ketamine, promethazine, so X (so wet)\nSo Thorazine, so morphine\nSo dope that they wanna have sex\nSo dope they wanna (fuck)\n\n\nHey now Tech, you know I've been the type\nTo not go all in on hoes I've been around\nBut the flow I spit gets hoes all in the zone\nThat I won\u2019t talk shit but oh my damn they wrong\nAnd these men calling in, they're wondering if I\u2019ma get with a little dick\nThey got no common sense and with no collage in\nTheir position is probably something insignificant\nIf you think I\u2019m a bitch 'cause I probably missed the game you kickin'\nThey be hollering, hope I acknowledging because I have been methodically\nDropping the common knowledge that I don\u2019t get down like that\nNow they be hounding a bitch or probably get with a trick\nOr a treat 'cause they dogs and they all gon' bark like that\nI\u2019m killing the game, killing the game, killing the game\nSo he feeling me, he want to bang, I want to wait\nSo he get at me, he want to say shit that make\nMe think that he gon' rape me if I don\u2019t stay\n'Cause I got that sickening style that built me a crowd\nAnd men and women feelin' me now and it's freaking me out\n'Cause I\u2019m just here to figure it out and what this is about\nBut I\u2019ma say it\u2019s getting so wild that it\u2019s tripping me out\n'Cause I\u2019m not here to kill the morale, just kill all these sounds\nBut lately when I spit to a crowd, these men just reach out\nAnd they tell me that they women is down, they gettin' aroused\nAnd they be tryin' to give me they child with a gin and a smile\nThey say they wanna (fuck)"

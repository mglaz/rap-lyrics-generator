        "\n\n\nAnd we smoking, toking potent herb\nPreaching spoken words that just might poke your nerves\nHope you ain't scared, my jeep go \"Scrrrr\"\nI peep the obscured, and what ain't normally easy to observe\nI swear I'm born abnormally absurd\nIf I give you a piece of mind, you've been disorderly disturbed\nThat's my word, flip similes and verbs, now I'm eating\nRetreating for seconds and thirds, y'all niggas seasoned\n(Oh, you salty)\nDon't worry what we ate, you don't want that plate\nI combine yours with mine quake, and make the earth shake\nSupernatural disaster on you half-ass rappers\nPass the herb to an actual pastor, word to the black lip bastard\nI drop knowledge like a Five Percenter\nEvery time I drop a line, it touch like five placentas\nSchooling your offspring, drop heat all spring\nAnd stay hot for five Novembers, I think y'all niggas lost me\n\n\n95 'til infinity time\nWe in disguise behind enemy lines\nWomen with no identity signs, they can't get my lines\nI used to give a fuck you could find\n\n95 'til infinity time\nWe in disguise behind enemy lines\nAnd I just kill it every time\n\n\nInstead of lead slugs, I spreads the love\nLike a bed bugaboo does, I'm in the W with your lovable slut\nI'm in the walls while you bugging her up\nI'll do your girl like this beat, straight fucking it up\nY'all niggas nothing to us, this feels like nuttin' to us\nSon, taught your daughter how to bust a nut for fun\nRecollect and collect the funds\nWhen she see the sun spit the proceeds when I cum\n'99, 'til infinity beyond\nHold my peace full of energy 'til enemies be gone\nUntil then niggas in my vicinity gone\nPeep the melody we on\nBut they don't know the remedy to these songs\nBasic necessities on how to be put on\nCause they see my team, we strong, Beastcoast in your region\nIf you get dropped you can't rejoin, they wanna know\nWhose shoulder we leaning on\nBut all we do is show them who we leading on\n\n\n95 'til infinity time\nWe in disguise behind enemy lines\nWomen with no identity signs, they can't get my lines\nI used to give a fuck you could find\n\n95 'til infinity time\nWe in disguise behind enemy lines\nAnd I just kill it every time\n\n\nCause they will never stop for a young black male\nBlackmailed in braille that means what he felt\nAnd the very reveal could appeal\nPut you on the Alcatraz trail or railroad to hell\nOh well, some of us is taught there is help\nThe other source is lost in all sorts of wealth\nUh, roots of all evil\nThe highest stars Evel Knievel\nI see through people's door, the world may never know\nHow my third pupil show, Incognito and cold needles flow\nAnd I don't throw subs, I throw torpedoes\nThe Don, not Cheadle, this don got a Cornelius fro\nAfro punk festivities\nThis for my negus that's lying with queens like Nefertiti\nWaking up to pyramids and big kitties\nGold soul theory, but what is life really\n\n\n95 'til infinity time\nWe in disguise behind enemy lines\nWomen with no identity signs, they can't get my lines\nI used to give a fuck you could find\n\n95 'til infinity time\nWe in disguise behind enemy lines\nAnd I just kill it every time"

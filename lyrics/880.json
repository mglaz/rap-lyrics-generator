        "\nWho's bad? Who's bad?\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\nWho's bad? Who's bad?\n(Wait, hold up)\nWho's bad?\n\n\nI'm representin' for the bitches\nAll eyes on your riches\nNo time for the little dicks\nYou see the bigger the dick\nThe bigger the bank, the bigger the Benz\nThe better the chance to get close to his rich friends\nI'm going after the big man\nMy g-string make his dick stand\nMake it quick, then slow head by the night stand\nLike lightning, I wanna nigga with a wedding ring\nBank accounts in the Philippines\nBlank note to take everything\nSee I fuck him in the living room\nWhile his children ain't home\nI make him eat it while my period on\nA little nasty ho, red-bone but a classy ho\nYoung jazzy ho and don't be scared\nIf you're curious just ask me hoes\nAnd yes dick sucking comes quite natural\nCause I'm da baddest bitch, what\n\n\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\n(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\n\n\nSee I hate hoes who take their niggas on talk shows and fought hoes\n(Y'all sold, fool)\nSee if I'm ever crossed or ever caught up in the cross\nAnd if it's your fault ho, I'm going off ho\nSee I'm unemployed with no boss ho\nWhile y'all sucking dick for free I'm broke off ho\nSee it pays to be the boss ho\nShit that's how you floss hoes\nX-rated elevated, buck naked\nAnd I'd probably fuck your daddy\nIf your mammie wasn't playa hatin'\nCause I'm da baddest bitch\nI'm da baddest bitch, what\n\n\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\n(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\n(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\n\n\nI got game for young hoes\nDon't grow to be a dumb ho, that's a no-no\nSee if you off the chains\nStay ahead of the game, save up buy a condo\nSell the pussy by the grands\nAnd in months you own a Benz\nAnother week a set of rims\nSee if I had the chance to be a virgin again\nI'd be fucking by the time I'm ten\nSee off glass is my motto\nDick suckin' in the auto\nQuick fuckin' 'bout to follow\nOn the back of the truck\nOr when I'm dead ass drunk\nBut I don't get high though\nI never took it up the ass\nOften tried but I pass\nAnd from what I heard it ain't bad\nI'm a curious bitch who took off to get broke off\nFrom the baby's dad\nCause I'm da baddest bitch\n\n\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\n(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\n(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\n(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\nWho's bad? Who's, who's bad?\n(That's right, I'm the baddest bitch)\nWho's bad?"

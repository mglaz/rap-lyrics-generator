        "\nHello, Trina, thank you for sending this\nGoodness, Trina, I am relieved\nFrankly, Trina, nice of you sending this\nThank you, Trina, I have received\nYour new-sent wedding invitations!\nThey are\n\n\nPseudo-romantic and sick!\n\n\nYou say you'll\n\n\nLove him until you both die!\n\n\nYou die on\n\n\nMay 27th at eight!\n\n\nHe has lost his mind\nMarvin is not so uncouth\nMarvin is not so unkind\n\n\nMendel plans to rub my back\nMendel's not a maniac\nAnd he's sweet\nAnd he's warm\nAnd he loves me so\n\n\nTell me, Trina, what was the impetus?\nSorry, Trina, look in my eyes\nReally, Trina, this is ridiculous\nJesus, Trina, how I despise\nYour need for stupid conversation!\n\nYou are\n\n\nTrying to ruin my sleep!\n\n\nI'm sure you\n\n\nChose him to make me look bad!\n\n\nHow could you\n\n\nEver deny what we had?\n\n\nWe had fights and games\nMarvin called us funny names\nMarvin always played the clown\n\n\nMarvin acts like he's untrained\nMarvin, I am so ashamed\n\n\nAnd he's sweet\nAnd he's mean\n\n\nDo I love him?\nNo\n\n\nI am so dumb\n\n\nDumb\nDumb\nDumb!\nDumb!\n\n\nWhy?"

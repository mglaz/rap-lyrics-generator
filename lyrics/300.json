I'm from the 312\nWhere cops don't come through and dreams don't come true\nLike there the God go, in his Murcielago\nFrom workin' McDonalds, barely payin' the car note\nHe even got enough, to get his mama a condo\nThen they ran up and shot him, right in front of his mom\n40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week\nMan, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street\nWelcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us\nWe got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon\nDid Moses not part the water with the cane?\nDid strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?\nDid Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?\nAnd ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?\nIn Jesus' name, let the choir say\n\"I'm on fire, ay,\" that's what Richard Pryor say\nAnd we'll annihilate anybody that violate\nAsk any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye\n\n\nShake that body, party that bod-\nShake that body, party that bod-\nShake that body, party that body\nCome and have a good time with G-O-D\n\n\nYeah nigga, yeah I had my, I had my Jesus piece since \u201894\nI don\u2019t know what I, I don\u2019t know what y'all talkin\u2019 bout\nAnd my eagle \u2014 still got it all in the bag, B\nYeah, all I did was play possum\nYo, come on\n\n\n600 Cuban cigar in the big tub\nMedallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut\nWith soap suds on the MAC-11\nMy big lion haven\u2019t ate since 12, and it\u2019s after seven\nWe feed the nigga like 40 chickens\nHis tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim\nUh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on\nGems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon\nI got soccer moms payin' for cock\nAsians get it from behind while they cleanin\u2019 their wok\nComin' with flows that is toxic\nDeadly fumes when I'm in the room\nRepercussions occur when you dry snitch\nRed light, green light, one, two, three\nLook mean, got my machine, cried and hit you, please\nSay shake that body, scar up that body\nShould I kill him now Tone? I said probably\nSide bets are four and better\nBust hammers with pot holders\nAnd yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather\nI\u2019m not bow-legged but old school like Redd Foxx\nMy favorite color in my hustle days was red tops\nMy gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock\nThrew it off my project roof, saw red dots\nKanye, shine a light on my Wallabees\nYou can have a good time with G.O.D\n\n\nShake that body, party that bod- (that's rare, nigga!)\nShake that body, party that bod- (Ric Flair, nigga!)\nShake that body, party that body (yeah, nigga!)\nCome and have a good time with G-O-D (yeah)\nShake that body, party that bod- (woah!)\nShake that body, party that bod- (woah!)\nShake that body, party that body (it's the new God flow, niggas)\nCome and have a good time with G-O-D (yo)\n\n\nG.O.O.D.

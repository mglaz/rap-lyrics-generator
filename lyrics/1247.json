        "\nI'm off a tab of that synthetic\nSundown, forty-five minutes 'til this shit set in (Whoop!)\nChecking for the kid, I had to chin check him\nBig mood, and we teach 'em big lessons over here (Over here!)\n2fo coming heavy like we bench pressing\nAnd I'm gon' deliver every time just like a sent message (Yuh!)\nIn the south and I'm feeling like a pimp\nYou a simp, I don't feel bad for you, I ain't sympathetic (Hey!)\n\n\nI just hit the peak, got the kids sweatin'\nOut of town chick, tryin' tell her what a Big Red is\nI'm a Kentucky boy 'til the death\nGo and get it through your head until it's motherfuckin' embedded (Hey!)\nShe said that I'm full of myself\nGo ahead and bust it open, I'ma show you what a big head is (Oh yeah!)\nHalf of us ain't even got a whip and we tryin' grip grain\nFirst step is go and get breaded\nHit you with the words of wisdom (Ooh!)\nNew Balance on me while I'm searching for sum'\nTrying to touch me out in public 'cause they heard I'm the one\nI peel off like my skin when it get burned in the sun (Skrt!)\nSelf conscious, face blush with ease\nLevis put a taper on my dungarees\nBut I'm still on the block when its a-hundred-three\nAnd humid in the city, but I'm sitting comfortably, yeah (Hey!)\n\n\nI'm off a tab of that synthetic\nSundown, forty-five minutes 'til this shit set in (Hey!)\nChecking for the kid, I had to chin check him\nBig mood, and we teach 'em big lessons over here\n2fo coming heavy like we bench pressing\nAnd I'm gon' deliver every time just like a sent message (Hey!)\nIn the south and I'm feeling like a pimp\nYou a simp, I don't feel bad  for you, I ain't sympathetic (Woah!)"

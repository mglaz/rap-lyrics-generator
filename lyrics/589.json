        "\nOh my\nOh my\n\n\nFuck the law, they can eat my dick, that's word to Pimp\nHold up (Oh my)\n(You are now listening to Run the Jewels 2)\nFuck the law, they can eat my dick, that's word to Pimp\nI don't fuck with or talk like all these fuckin' imps\nStyle violent, give a fuck if you deny it, kids\nYou can all run naked backwards through a field of dicks\nFuck the world, don't ask me for shit, that's word to B.I.G\nI dreamt we owned the world\nBut I've woken up and it don't exist\nSoak it in, I need no assist\nYou can't slap my wrist, I don't owe you shit\nTrust me, I'm a Doctor DOOM, oper-\nRate of my pulse won't raise a bit\n\n\nTip-toe on the track like a ballerina\nSki mask, in a Pontiac Catalina\nIt's obese female opera singer\nYou can run the jewels or lose your fingers\nMe and El-P got time to kill\nGot folks to kill, on overkill\nHe hangin' out the window, I hold the wheel\nOne black, one white, we shoot to kill\nThat fuckboy life about to be repealed\nThat fuckboy shit about to be repelled\nFuckboy Jihad, kill infidels\nAllah Akbar, BOOM, from Mike and El\n\n\nLife is hell, death's a bitch\nAnd these fubar rulers getting rich\nI cop a zip, it opens up\nI smoke it up, go home and fuck\nC'est la vie girl, when in Rome\nI gave the face, please pay with dome\nMy business card says, \"You're in luck\nI do two things, I rap and fuck\"\n\n\nI fuck and rap, I tote the strap\nI smoke the kush, I beat the puss\nI read the books, did the math\nDon't need a preacher preachin' on my behalf\nNo teacher can teach my arrogant ass\nI'm blowin' on crippy while readin' inscriptions\nThat's written by Egyptians, and sippin' on whiskey\n(Hahahaha) Aye baby, you with me?\n\n\nOh my\nDon't cry\nOh my\nDon't cry\nOh my\nDon't cry\nOh my\nDon't cry\n\n\n(Whip Crack!) We run this spot like a Chinese sweatshop\nDon't stop, work it, work it 'til chest pop; Cardiac arrested\nI'm so invested, I'm self-invented\nThat's no illusion, there's no confusion\nYou see the future, you fear the future\nI've seen the truth and I'm so deluded\nI've! Been a better bad guy than I been, better than bad\nBeen a bit a bully talk, beating on my chest, in fact\nI'm a half stack from a rack\nI been around the block, babe, I know a few facts\nManiac, brainiac, run, go tell them that\nATLien, NY felon rap\n\n\nHandle me wrong I'm snappin'\nShow up at your class, what's happenin'?\nSchoolyard bully with a fully automatic\nHeart full of pain and a head full of havoc\nEverybody stepped on the kid and I'm letting them have it, Havoc\nLeaving they momma to say, \"What happened!?\"\nWho gon' buy my baby a casket? Fuck that bitch, I'm a bastard\n\n\nMegablast, I'm mega lit\nOn Highway 6 and I'm not strapped in\nI don't crash, bitch, I just skid\nYou got the cash? I'll make the trip\nI make the trip, you better pay\nDone worse for less, don't make my day\nI'm not from Earth, from far away\nI bust through chests like baby greys\n\n\nRunnin' the jewels of the game\nWhippin' the mix is like chickens of 'caine\nSpittin' the sentence again, parents is livid again\nKids is just fuckin' insane\nPointin' that pistol and fist for the chain\nReppin' the symbol like they in a gang\nDelivery dope like a dosage of dope\nOr a noseful of coke for a junkie or fiend\n\n\nOh my\nDon't cry\nOh my\nDon't cry"

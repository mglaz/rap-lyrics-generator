        "\nBrown bless the mic like gesundheit\nBud 'bout the size of a bonsai\nKick it like Muay Thai, flow like Sci-Fi in high def\nI'm righteous and still bust a nut up on a bitch chest\nThe verbal folklore been explored\nAnd employed by none other than them fools with the gold\nAnd them bankrolls explode\nAnd your bitch in my target when I shoot my load\nBullseye, my eyes tie-dyed\nFried off the same shit that rockstars died... from\nSmoke somethin' with your man, bitch\nLike Wyclef, used to sell the cannabis\nManuscript, sick shit, prescription addiction\nSniffing Adderall off the counter in my kitchen\nTripping off the shit that had Brian Wilson flipping\nExperiment so much, it's a miracle I'm livin'\n\n\nAnd I'ma die like a rockstar\nDie like a rockstar\nI'ma die like a rockstar\nDie like a rockstar\nI'ma die like a rockstar\nDie like a rockstar\nI'ma die like a rockstar\n\n\nBitch, I wanna party like Chris Farley\nShot of Hennessy, spike that with some molly\nTell mommy I'm sorry, God bless my soul\nBut life was so sublime, goin' out like Brad Nowell\nI got that Kurt Cobain type of mindframe\nFeelin' like Keith Moon, shrooms in my dressing room\nBasquiat freestyle\nFeeling like Jimi Hendrix in Anna-Nicole mouth\nRiver Phoenix, '93, VIP\nWith some drugged-up porn hoes all around me\nLike Teri Diver, Linda Wong\nAll in hell havin' orgies where the horns growing long\n'Cause, bitch, I'm Frankie Lymon, Heath Ledger\nHyped up in a jacuzzi, doing that John Belushi\nWith Brittany Murphy, we blowin' hershey\nI'ma die like a rockstar"

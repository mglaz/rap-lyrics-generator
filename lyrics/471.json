        "\n\n\nYeah, let's take 'em back\nUh-huh\n\n\nComing up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl\nConfusion occurs coming up in the cold world\nDaddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies\nMy favorite rapper used to sing, \"Check, check out my melody\"\nI wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope\nFor a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes\nNana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat\nIf I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope\nTossed and turned in my sleep that night\nWoke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike\nDifferent day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood\nI'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could\n\n\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me\n\n\n(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider\nGuns on both sides, right above the gold wires\nI'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song\nAnd really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter\n10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces\nBelieve you me, homie, I know all about losses\nI'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious\nOne phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy\nI stay strapped, like car seats\nBeen bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys\nThat's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95\nI'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's\nTold Banks when I met him I'ma ride\nAnd if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide\nI ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died\nNow I'm going back to Cali\nWith my Jacob on, see how time fly?\n\n\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me\n\n\nFrom the beginning to the end\nLosers lose, winners win\nThis is real, we ain't got to pretend\nThe cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain\nEnough of me, nigga, now listen to Game\n\n\nUsed to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench\nNow I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense\nMy mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent\nAnd she got a red bow on that brand new Benz\nWaiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range\nThinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes\nWhen there's kids starvin'\nPac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage\nI wanna know what's going on, like I hear Marvin\nNo schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins\nWhenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted\nI think, \"What if Marie Baker got that abortion?\" I love you, ma\n\n\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me\nHate it or love it, the underdog's on top\nAnd I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop\nGo 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P\nAnd I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me"

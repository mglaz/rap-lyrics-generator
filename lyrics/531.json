        "\nI was tryna  get it how I live\nI want them dead presidents\nI wanna pull up, head spin\nGet it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired\nGet it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired\n\n\nFull time father, full time artist\nAsked God, he said \"Grind harder\"\nLearn from every time you ever fail\nIf it never fail just grind smarter\nIron sharpens, you the dagger\nOn they hindquarters and they all acting\nRap game, I'm a pallbearer\nKill me and get a call after\nFirst look, it was all laughter\nKevin Gates, no small matter\nMade men believe what they didn't believe\nDive in the crowd, no safety harness\nGun in the booth, no safety on it\nAim and I shoot for the stars\nAt the awards I ain't win no awards\nOnly meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard\n\n\nI was tryna  get it how I live\nI want them dead presidents\nI wanna pull up, head spin\nGet it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired\nGet it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired\n\n\nMe and the woman I love on an air mattress\nWe share a cot, my hair nappy\nCouldn't afford flights, no air travel\nStale Rice Krispies like sand and gravel\nOur testament to what can happen\nThe moment you follow your heart\nKeeping the faith even when it get dark\nThey say give up as I tell them \"Get lost\"\nSix weeks ago I just purchased a foreign\nMost likely the one that you cannot afford\nRight foot on the gas\nBalenciaga be accelerating, I'm doing the dash\nChick that I'm with\nShorty be doing her shit and it's okay to say that she bad\nLook to the right and I give her a glance\nPray to God we don't, pray to God we don't crash\n\n\nI was tryna  get it how I live\nI want them dead presidents\nI wanna pull up, head spin\nGet it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired\nGet it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired\n\n\nOnly meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard\nDon't play with the hustle, you eat or you starve\nDon't mimic pretenders, just be who you are\nAin't never change, been like this from the start\nOnly meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard\nDon't play with the hustle, you eat or you starve\nDon't mimic pretenders, just be who you are\nGet it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired\n\n\nI was tryna  get it how I live\nI want them dead presidents\nI wanna pull up, head spin\nGet it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired, I don't get, I don't get tired\nGet it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired\n\n\nAnd I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired\nAnd I don't get tired\nGet it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired"

        "\nBitch, you ain't gettin' no money\n\n\nI might have to slap a hoe\nYou lackin', I'ma whack you hoe\nForty on my waist\nMight catch a case\nBut I ain't lackin' though\nNever catch me slippin' bitch\nNever catch me slippin' hoe\nNever catch me slippin' bitch\nNever catch me slippin' hoe\nNever catch me slippin' hoe\n\n\nDisrespectful bitch\nSpell yo name with this clip\nAudi 4 door finna dip\nYeah I'm always makin' trips\nMy big brother got a problem\nHe don't like you fuckin crips\nI finesse em then I dip\nGet a bag and take a trip\nCause I'm all about my money\nNow these bitches actin funny\nKeep my 30 and my 40 cause I gotta keep my pistol\nCause they might just try to get you\nI don't smoke no fuckin swishers\nCall Molly she gon wipe yo ass out just like some tissue\nMan this bitch don't want the issue\nMake yo fuckin momma miss you\nI'm the fuckin school teacher\nBitches better pay attention\nClass in session\nBetter listen\nI'ma teach y'all ass a lesson\nI ain't with the sneak dissin'\nBitches' neck ain't glistening\n\n\nI might have to slap a hoe\nYou lackin', I'ma whack you hoe\nForty on my waist\nMight catch a case\nBut I ain't lackin' though\nNever catch me slippin' bitch\nNever catch me slippin' hoe\nNever catch me slippin' bitch\nNever catch me slippin' hoe\nNever catch me slippin' hoe"

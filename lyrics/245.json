        "\nUh\nJoyner, Joyner, Joyner\nSober minds\nDead silence\nYuh, listen, look\n\n\nI don't take no fucking percocets\nMolly, Percocets\nNo ecstasy, promethazine\nNo lean, no purple mess\nNo dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step\nIf you don't think that I'm the shit, it's just cause you ain't heard me yet\nI'm 'bout to put my mask on, my mask on\nStick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone\nI know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long\nI know you wasn't expecting this shit but you asked for it\n\n\nI'm about to grab niggas by the throat\nI'm about to crash Lil Yachty boat\nI'm about to drag niggas by the coat\nTake out your trash, sit it by the door\nShit, I got the mask on me, I'm 'bout to go\nI hate when niggas act funny when I'm alone\nAnd try to give daps to me and tip their hats to me\nAnd they act gully when they at home\nYeah, I don't do Xannies or Mollys\nDon't come near me with problems\nAnd don't you compare me to Logic (never)\nGo listen to Sriracha\nYeah, that's Amanda to Ronda\nAnd that's a Benz to a Honda\nYeah, that's a dance with the devil\nAnd I ain't dancing behind ya\nMy nigga, I'm a muthafucking entity\nYou don't get it, even landlords gotta pay rent to me\nGingerbread man fuckers ain't catchin' me\nSick and tired of niggas sickening, depressing me\nGo to church, I testify\nPray to God I bless the beat\nKanye said \"Touch the Sky\"\nFuture might come for me\nBut I'm a fucking beast and if I die, that sucks for me\nBut where the crown I'ma kill the king\nI bet a lot of haters won't feel the same\nI dug the ground, I built the ring\nI cut the cow I milked the game, nigga\nI should cut a hole in the sky\nMake you feel the rain, nigga feel the pain, nigga\nA lot of rap niggas get nervous when they hear my name, nigga\nI'm insane, nigga\nBack when you was watching Leave It To Beaver\nI was crushing on Tila Tequila\nI was swagging in Adidas and Filas\nFuckin' divas call 'em Venus, Serena\nSigned my deal and told em Cesar's a beater\nHope you didn't think I needed you neither\nTake it back and told 'em I didn't mean it\n'Cause my uncle said it's cheaper to keep it\n\n\nMask off, run in the back door\nBlast y'all hats off\nFuck is you mad for?\nI catch y'all, smash y'all\nDon't mean to laugh hard\nBut all you funny to me\nNone of you niggas half hard\nYou think you comin' for me but you never could last long\nYou don't mean nothin' to me\nAnd I come with some shit that'll make you niggas {Imitates mumble rap flow}\nLike that mumble rap shit (laugh)\nWhoo, whoo!\nMask off, run in the back door\nBlast y'all hats off\nFuck is you mad for?\nI catch y'all, smash y'all\nDon't mean to laugh hard\nBut all you funny to me\nNone of you niggas half hard\nYou runnin comin' for me but you never could last long\nYou don't mean nothin' to me\nAnd I come with some shit\nThat'll make you niggas bump into me with a couple of weapons\nAnd be afraid to get it poppin', now they duckin' and dippin', I mean\nWhat's up with you mumble niggas that never say nothin'?\nI'm about to make all of you fuckers go to bed in the oven\nI go to sleep with the devil and wake up next to your mother\nAnd you ain't telling me nothing\nI mean I'm very disgustin'\nI mean I'm ready to bust and\nPut an end to you fucker, now what's what?\nHow many CDs could a woodchuck chuck\nIf he chucked it at every single nigga that sucked?\nHuh?\n\n\nLook, all you a lie\nI don't cuff no hoes, you can have my bitch\nI don't even mind\nIt seems like all these hoes wanna do is switch up\nThey rather be a guy\nIf she could suck my dick everyday for a living\nThen that'd be her job, yuh\nI said candy paint in yo fuckin' rims\n.38 in yo fuckin' Benz\nI was broke as fuck had a couple friends\nA refrigerator and a cup of gin\nLet's drink it up, me and you\n'Cause these niggas fake, and I see it too\nAnd they try to get me to pop Percocets and Molly\nAnd I said\n\n\nI don't take no fucking percocets\nMolly, Percocets\nNo ecstasy, promethazine\nNo lean, no purple mess\nNo dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step\nIf you don't think that I'm the shit it's just cause you ain't heard me yet\nI'm about to put my mask on, my mask on\nStick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone\nI know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long\nI know you wasn't expecting this shit but you asked for it\n\n\nMask off, run in the back door\nBlast y'all hats off\nFuck is you mad for?\nI catch y'all, smash y'all\nDon't mean to laugh hard\nBut all you funny to me\nNone of you niggas half hard\nYou think you comin' for me but you never could last long\nYou don't mean nothin' to me\nAnd I come up some shit I (inaudible)\nWhoo, whoo!\nMask off, run in the back door\nBlast y'all hats off\nFuck is you mad for?\nI catch y'all, smash y'all\nDon't mean to laugh hard\nBut all you funny to me\nNone of you niggas half hard\nYou think you comin' for me but you never could last long\nYou don't mean nothin' to me\nAnd I'm coming with some shit\nThat'll make you niggas bump into me with a couple of weapons\nAnd be afraid to get it poppin', now they duckin' and dippin', I mean\nWhat's up with you mumble niggas who never say nothin'?\nI'm about to make all of you fuckers go to bed in the oven\nI go to sleep with the devil and wake up next to your mother\nAnd you ain't telling me nothing\nI mean I'm very disgustin'\nI mean I'm ready to bust and\nPut an end to you fucker, now what's what?\nHow many CDs could a woodchuck chuck\nIf he chucked it at every single nigga that sucked?\nWhat the fuck? Fuck!"

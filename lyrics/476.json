        "\nShe got on tights with the leather skin\nShe a rockstar, bring the heavy metal in\nGirl shaped like a coke bottle, Medell\u00edn\nIn love with her 'til she went and let the devil in\nShe pop pills like medicine\nShe probably gon' die, it's startin' to be evident\nI told her, \"Slow down, girl you're heaven-sent\"\nI'm a thug but I got a heart like Kev and them\nAnd I can't let this girl throw her life away\nKick her dorm room in and told her put the knife away\nTook her to the hospital like right away\nShe a angel with demons, the girl like night and day\nStressed out, parents getting divorced\nGirl love 'em both, she ain't tryin' to sit in court\nShe a square so it's hard to see the angle\nAnd that's why God gave her an guardian angel\nIt's me, and I'm here for her, swear to God that I'm here for her\nLast nigga got her caught up in the airport\nShe ain't had no pride, so she went and did a year for him\nShe a ride-or-die, like Eve and them\nMake home-cooked meals every evening\nStart stripping on the side, now I'm tipping on the side\nLove life like Joselin and Stevie and them\nAm I wrong for being the best that I can to her?\nTakin' her son and tryin' to be a man to him\nShe don't wanna pray, but I told her put her hands to it\nI done came a long way from that tan Buick\nYeah, grandmother would be proud of me\nAlmost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me\nRemember momma knockin' on the door hounding me\nBought her a car and a crib even though she doubted me\n\n\n(When I wake up every day) even though she doubted me\n(I thank the lord that we are safe) even though she doubted me\n(Again, yeah) even though she doubted me\n(That's why you should pray for me)\nThat's my momma and I love her with my heart like I love you\nIf you strugglin', baby daddy ain't takin' care of the kids\nGirl, you can get a hug too\nI'm here whenever you need me, gon' reach out, it's that easy\nI love women, cause without women\nWouldn't none of us niggas be breathin'\nSo let's\n\n\n(Pray) Bow your head\n(Pray) Bow your head\n(Pray) Bow your head\n(Pray) Bow your head\n(Pray) Bow your head\n(Pray) Bow your head\n(Pray) Bow your head\n(Pray) Cole\n\n\nGood girl at heart - I remember you well, I remember you well\nGot a husband and kid, but I flirt, hope you do a little dirt\nCause I'm diggin' you still, that's real\nBut na you don't text back and deep down I respect that\nCause even though a nigga wanna tap that shit\nI don't wanna be the one to wreck that shit\nSo, so I fall back, year go by I got more plaques\nJust to get a call from you tellin' me you miss me\nAnd you wanna see me next time the tour's back, damn\nWell what changed then? She tellin' me a nigga had her caged in\nEvery time she think about me on the road\nShe be cryin' realizin' all the places that she ain't been\nWell it's cool, I'll pick you up, hold you down, lift you up\nThese other niggas try and fuck\nI'm the only one who cut and still came back to stitch you up\nSo we fuck, say what? You ain't been home lately\nYou ain't heard that nigga? Her man left cause she cheated on his ass\nFound her pills in a bag, yo she burned that nigga\n(She burned that nigga)\nSay what? She burned that nigga (she burned that nigga)\nSay what? She burned that nigga\nDawg, she burned that nigga\nHe beat her ass in the crib then he went and did a bid\nAll cause a bitch burned that nigga\nNow dog, that's real ass shit\nThat's word around the ville ass shit\nDid you strap up? Did you the strap up?\nPlease tell me that you strapped up nigga\nWe could kill that bitch if you want to\nI'm cool, I strapped up, played by the rules, damn\nWhile I'm sittin' here blessed, she at the crib all alone and she stressed\nSo nigga I\n\n\nPray, bow your head\n(Pray) Bow your head\n(Pray) Bow your head\n(Pray) Just bow your head\n(Pray) Bow your head\n(Pray) Bow your head\n(Pray) Bow your head\n(Pray) Bow your head\n\n\nWhen I wake up every day\nI thank the lord that we are safe\nAgain, yeah\nThat's why you should pray for me\nWhen I wake up every day\nI thank the lord that we are safe\nAmen, ooooh\nThat's why you should pray for me - that's why you should pray"

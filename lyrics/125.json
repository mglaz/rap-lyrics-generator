        "\nOoh, ahh, ahh, ahh\nDon't go, don't go to sleep\nDon't go, stay up and\n\n\nTired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind\nTired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie\nTired of feelin' like my life is a damn game\nNigga really wanna die in the night time\n\n\nOnly time I feel pain, when I'm feelin' love\nThat's why it's tatted on my face that I'm damn numb\nOnly tell you 'bout my mind when I'm all alone\nThat's why I'm never really 'lone in the night time\nChange hoes like clothes, I can't get attached\n'Cause these hoes fire starters like lit matches\nI've been feelin' really lost, duckin' all attachments\nI don't really go outside 'cause I hate traffic\nI don't wanna go outside, get caught in traffic, traffic\n\n\nOoh, ahh, ahh, ahh\nDon't go, don't go to sleep\nDon't go, stay up and\n\n\nTired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind\nTired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie\nTired of feelin' like my life is a damn game\nNigga really wanna die in the night time\nTired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind\nTired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie\nTired of feelin' like my life is a damn game\nNigga really wanna die in the night time\nTired of feelin' like I'm trapped in my damn mind\nTired of feelin' like I'm wrapped in a damn lie\nTired of feelin' like my life is a damn game\nNigga really wanna die in the night time\nNigga really wanna die in the night time\nNigga really wanna die in the night time\nNigga really wanna die in the night time, uh\nNigga really wanna die in the night time, uh\nNigga really wanna die in the night time\n\n\nDon't go to sleep\nDon't go, stay up and\nDon't go, don't go to sleep\nDon't go, stay up and don't\nOoooahahh\nDon't go, don't go to sleep\nDon't go, stay up and don't"

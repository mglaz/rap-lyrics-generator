        "\nAll she ever wanted was a real one\nBut that's so hard to find\nA big future, she just want to built one\nBut all she gets is wasted time\nCause she keep falling' for them flaw ass niggas\nCause she keep falling' for them flaw ass niggas\nAll she ever wanted was a REAL ONE\nBut that's so hard to find\nEven though she's so fine\n\n\nI keep yelling 'Fuck boy this' and 'Fuck boy that'\nShould've never let the fuckboy tap\nGotta blame myself\nI should've been gone\nYou's a new ass nigga\nI been on, I been on, I been on\nShould've never let you out the friends zone\nNiggas like you make me so sick\nI guess you got the lame nigga syndrome\nBack to the money doe\nI'm still talking big money ho!\nI ain't about that flex, I'm about that check\nThat's for any nigga who wanna know\nI throw the deuce up and cop Medusas\nI pull the trucks out, I put the coupes up\nI don't take no losses, I'm no loser\nBig business, is what I'm used to\n\n\nAll she ever wanted was a real one\nBut that's so hard to find\nA big future, she just want to built one\nBut all she gets is wasted time\nCause she keep falling' for them flaw ass niggas\nCause she keep falling' for them flaw ass niggas\nAll she ever wanted was a REAL ONE\nBut that's so hard to find\nEven though she's so fine!\n\n\nI shop myself, I cop myself\nFor myself, by myself\nGot my health, got my wealth\nGot my own, don't need no help\nKnow how to play with the cards I'm dealt\nBut it would be nice to have a REAL ONE\nPicket fences and a lil one\nFly nigga with a bankroll\nEducated, but still to know how to kill some\nIs that too much to ask?\nDo I want too much, too fast?\nDo I drive these niggas mad\nSoon as they touch the ass?\nCan't teach these boys to be men though\nShould've learned that from they kinfolk\nAnd I should've known what I was in for\nSoon as I gave the fuck nigga my info\n\n\nAll she ever wanted was a real one\nBut that's so hard to find\nA big future, she just want to built one\nBut all she gets is wasted time\nCause she keep falling' for them flow ass niggas\nCause she keep falling' for them flow ass niggas\nAll she ever wanted was a REAL ONE\nBut that's so hard to find\nEven though she's so fine\n\n\nOh, I hope that situation don't drive you out your mind\nAnd I won't talk about no nigga\nI'll only tell you what it would be like if I was, if I was your nigga\nLet's let the old shit remain the old shit\nLeave it in the past, and we'll remain focus\nSay you got an ex, but I ain't even noticed\nI ain't trippin' 'bout that nigga or my old bitch\nI just know what I be on, got a California King to put your body on\nMake a nigga mad when we put on that ass\nBut the Og got the shady form\nAll she ever wanted was a real one\nBut that's so hard to find\nA big future, she just want to built one\nBut all she gets is wasted time\nCause she keep falling' for them flaw ass niggas\nCause she keep falling' for them flaw ass niggas\nAll she ever wanted was a REAL ONE\nBut that's so hard to find\nEven though she's so fine!"

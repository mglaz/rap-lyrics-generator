        "\n\n\nThere's a field with angels movin' around me\nI just worship thee, for all he's done for me\nIt's a new day, I have been born again\nI've been born again, I've been born again\nIn His spirit, and His name, I'm sanctified!\nLord I testify, he's right by my side\nI believe it be, His word is so clear to me\nYeah, yeah\n\n\nAll I want's a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch\nPlus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage\nGroupies in the lobby, they just tryna get established\nGod, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status\nAll I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch\nPlus that paper chasin', it had turned me to a savage\nGroupies in the lobby they just tryna get established\nGod, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status\n\n\nNiggas be lovin' the old Ye, they sayin' the new Ye, that nigga be spazzin'\nBut when Ali turn up and be Ali, you can't ever change that nigga back to Cassius\nSo you can gon' and make up lies, but I'm so sanctified\nI don't sweat it, wipe my forehead with a handkerchief\nAnd wash my sins in the blood of Jesus (Ross grunt)\nPeople sayin', \"Ye we need another Yeezus\" (Ross grunt)\nLames try to tell me, \"Cut the wildin' out, out\"\nBut who the fuck is you reachin'?\nPass me 30 bottles, champagne procession\nThat's that Holy water, sanctified refreshments\nGod sent me a message, said I'm too aggressive\nReally!? Me!? Too aggressive!?\n\n\nI can feel his blessings wash away my sins\nI'm sanctified and, I have been born again\nNow I proclaim, hallowed be thy name\nOhhh\n\n\nAll I want's a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch\nPlus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage\nGroupies in the lobby, they just tryna get established\nGod, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status\n\n\nKeys to my success, I get new keys and new address\nBitches that I date don't get degrees but they can dress\nFellatio's amazin', make grilled cheese for you, the best\nMajor cult figure, I'm the fresh David Koresh\nSoldiers all in gators, new Mercedes for cadets\nBalmain uniform, you know Donda designed the vest\nDouble M, that be the Army, better yet, the Navy\nBaby seen me in that Wraith, wanna have my baby\nAll I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch\nNow I want two hundred and m\u00e9nage in my palace\nWalkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' balance\nSomewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice\nRims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I was childish\n'Til I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was stylish\nWhen we fucked again, she told me \"That was just some foul shit\"\nI walk into the room, you can even hear all the silence\n\n\nI can feel his blessings wash away my sins\nI'm sanctified and, I have been born again\nNow I proclaim, hallowed be thy name\nOhhh"

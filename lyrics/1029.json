        "\nHow can you expect me to stay\nAfter all the things you've done?\nI don't wanna feel this anymore, no\nWhy do you expect to be forgiven because you're a man?\nAre your excuses worth much more?\n\n\nWhat if I told you I was out loving another man?\nWhat if I told you it didn't mean a thing?\nWhat if I told you that I loved you so, but these hoes, I can't let go?\nCould you handle all the things that you told me?\nHow 'bout some reverse psychology?\n\n\nOh-oh\nHow 'bout some reverse psychology, yeah?\nOh-oh-oh\n\n\nAfter the conversation we had\nAfter all the moments we shared\nHow could you do these things to me?\n(These things to me)\nLike love was supposed to make me stand by\nAnd watch you tell me those lies\nWhy would you do me that way?\n\n\nWhat if I told you I was out loving another man?\nWhat if I told you it didn't mean a thing?\nWhat if I told you that I loved you so, but these hoes, I can't let go?\nCould you handle all the things that you told me?\nHow 'bout some reverse psychology?\n\n\nOh-oh\nHow 'bout some reverse psychology, yeah?\nOh-oh-oh\n\n\nLadies, if you love someone and he broke your heart\nAnd you feel what I'm talking about\nLet me hear you say \"Yeah\"\nLet me hear you say \"Yeah\"\nLadies, if you love someone and he broke your heart\nAnd you feel what I'm talking about\nLet me hear you say \"Yeah\"\nLet me hear you say \"Yeah\"\n\n\nWhat if I told you I was out loving another man? (What if I told you?)\nWhat if I told you it didn't mean a thing? (It didn't mean a thing, no)\nWhat if I told you that I loved you so, but these hoes, I can't let go?\nCould you handle all the things that you told me? (Handle)\nHow 'bout some reverse psychology?\n\n\nOh-oh\nHow 'bout some reverse psychology, yeah?\nOh-oh-oh-ooh\nHow 'bout some reverse psychology, yeah?\nOh-oh-oh"

        "Somewhere out there, beneath the pale moonlight\nSomeone's thinking of me and loving me tonight\nSomewhere out there, someone's saying a prayer\nThat we'll find one another in that big somewhere out there\n\nAnd even though I know how very far apart we are\nIt helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star\nAnd when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby\nIt helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky!\n\nSomewhere out there, if love can see us through\nThen we'll be together\nSomewhere out there\nOut where dreams come true..."

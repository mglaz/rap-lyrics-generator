op\nClick, click, click, and the flows don't stop\n'Til I got more cream than Cold Stone got\nLike a boatload, nigga I'ma float on top\n'Til the grass don't grow and the wind don't blow\nAnd the po-po don't kill niggas no more\nI bought a thirty round extendo\nIf a nigga wanna duck, then I'm playing Duck Hunt\nIn real life, not on Nintendo\nLooking out the window like Malcolm X with the rifle\nClimb the steps up the Eiffel\nBarely broke a bead of sweat, whoa\nMany hope to be the best, oh\nCannot fuck with me just yet, though\nJ.I.D the closest thing to me\nC'est la vie, my vocal range putting\nBlood stains on Notre Dame hoodies\nHello fiends, I brought novocaine plus dopamine\nYou can load your veins with the product I slang\nNiggas gon' honor my name, boy, I'm a god in this game\nY'all niggas homonyms, sounding the same\nNot in my lane so I can't complain\nMe and Ben Frank got a damn good thing goin' on\nWay more than a random fling\nCole and J.I.D with a tandem, niggas can't stand 'em\nGot a new anthem, look at my whip\nSlit on my wrist, suicide, suicide doors on my Phantom\n\n\nGet off my dick, get off my dick\n.40 my hip, loadin' my clip\nCannabis, cannabis, roll up my spliff\nHannibal, Hannibal, look what I did\nEdible, edible, got the munchies\nBut I got the bungees, I'ma jump off this ship\nBut I bet he get whipped with the pistol grip\nNigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shit\n\n\nGet off my dick (Yeah)\nGet off my dick (Whoa)\nGet off my dick (Yeah)\nGet off my dick (Whoa)\nGet off my dick (Yeah)\nGet off my dick (Yeah)\nGet off my dick

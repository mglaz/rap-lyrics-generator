        "\nMy nigga, my go-to\nYou never told me\nMontana\n\n\nIt be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'\nGot the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nAnd I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nShe ain't tryna be a freak, but them bands keep poppin'\nStill caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'\nIt be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nBite down, bite down\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nBite down, bite down\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\n\n\nI'll chew your lil' mup, I'll boot a nigga up\nGot them snipers in the dually truck and we tooly-ed up\nI be tryna change my life, but the monkey on my back\nI've been rollin' all night, I got a monkey on my back\nSkrrt, skrrt, all about the mula ('Bout the mula)\nThrow a hundred chains on, tryna cool off (Bling)\nI know a nigga blessed, pray to God (Pray to God)\nSoon as the floor hit my feet, I'm getting high (Gettin' high)\nEyes bowleg, lookin' crooked in the face\nShe keep lookin' in her drink, probably think the liquor laced\nNah, bitch, I'm 1K, and I'ma keep it one hundo\nBitin' down, 'bout to rip my tongue off\n\n\nIt be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'\nGot the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nAnd I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nShe ain't tryna be a freak, but them bands keep poppin'\nStill caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'\nIt be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nBite down, bite down\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nBite down, bite down\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\n\n\nSlidin' in the Cutlass and you know I paint it candy\nThen I pulled up in a bucket, but I used to want a Hemi\nAnd I'm pourin' up the brown, damn, I'm sippin' on Remy\nI ain't fuckin with that white shit, I'm throwed off Henny-'enny\nPull up to the back, black Zack 'chief rockin'\nAnd the feds keep lurkin' 'cause the boys keep talkin'\nRitz Carlton, ran off on the plug about forty times\nForty niggas strapped, we the 49ers\nBite down, Karlton Hines\nGot two twin bitches doin' 69\nJump off to the mula and you know that\nFifty chains on, diamonds flashin' like Kodak\nI remember totin' .38, now I got a semi\nCould have been had a baby K, but I wasn't ready\nShawty say she like my Larry Pack, thought I went to Kelly\nNah, baby, I don't want the Wap, I just want the fetty\n\n\nIt be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'\nGot the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nAnd I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nShe ain't tryna be a freak, but them bands keep poppin'\nStill caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'\nIt be hard to understand me, my jaw keep lockin'\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nBite down, bite down\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nBite down, bite down\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\n\n\nAyy, ayy, ayy\nAyy, ayy, ayy\nAyy, ayy, ayy, ayy\nSkrrt, ayy\nAyy, ayy, ayy\nAyy, ayy, ayy\nBite down, bite down\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nBite down, bite down\nIt be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'\nAyy, ayy, ayy"

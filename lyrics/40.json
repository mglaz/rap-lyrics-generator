        "\nChill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill\nChill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill\n\n\nMy mama was raised in the era when\nClean water was only served to the fairer skin\nDoin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help\nBut they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself\nYou see it's broke nigga racism\nThat's that \"Don't touch anything in the store\"\nAnd it's rich nigga racism\nThat's that \"Come in, please buy more\"\n\"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?\nAll you blacks want all the same things\"\nUsed to only be niggas, now everybody playin'\nSpendin' everything on Alexander Wang\nNew slaves\n\n\nYou see it's leaders and it's followers\nBut I'd rather be a dick than a swallower\nYou see it's leaders and it's followers\nBut I'd rather be a dick than a swallower\n\n\nI throw these Maybach keys, I wear my heart on the sleeve\nI know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves\nI see the blood on the leaves, I see the blood on the leaves\nI know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves\nThey throwin' hate at me, want me to stay at ease\nFuck you and your corporation, y'all niggas can't control me\nI know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new slaves\nI'm 'bout to wild the fuck out, I'm goin' Bobby Boucher\nI know that pussy ain't free, you niggas pussy, ain't me\nY'all throwin' contracts at me, you know that niggas can't read\nThrow on some Maybach keys, fuck it, c'est la vie\nI know that we the new slaves, y'all niggas can't fuck with me\nY'all niggas can't fuck with Ye, y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye\nI'll move my family out the country so you can't see where I stay\nSo go and grab the reporters, so I can smash their recorders\nSee, they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the New World Order\nMeanwhile the DEA teamed up with the CCA\nThey tryna lock niggas up, they tryna make new slaves\nSee, that's that privately owned prison, get your piece today\nThey prolly all in the Hamptons, braggin' 'bout what they made\nFuck you and your Hampton house, I'll fuck your Hampton spouse\nCame on her Hampton blouse and in her Hampton mouth\nY'all 'bout to turn shit up, I'm 'bout to tear shit down\nI'm 'bout to air shit out, now what the fuck they gon' say now?\n\n\nI won't end this high, not this time again\nSo long, so long, so long, you cannot survive\nAnd I'm not dyin', and I can't lose\nI can't lose, no, I can't lose\n'Cause I can't leave it to you\nSo let's get too high, get too high again\nToo high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo\nYeah, h-h-h-high, h-high-high, high-high high-igh-high-high\nH-high-igh, yeah, high, high-igh\nEgyszer a Nap \u00fagy elf\u00e1radt (mhm-igh)\nElaludt m\u00e9ly z\u00f6ld t\u00f3 \u00f6l\u00e9n\nAz embereknek f\u00e1jt a s\u00f6t\u00e9t\n\u0150 megsajn\u00e1lt, elj\u00f6tt k\u00f6z\u00e9nk\n\n"

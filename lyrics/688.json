        "\nKeep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\nKeep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\n(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\n(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\n\n\nRock the boat like a one-eyed pirate\nRick James, I get glitter on my eyelids\n2 A.M., 85 on the highway\nWhole world get a little misguided\nWhere the spotlight? Put me in the spotlight\nTrust no one that put you in the wrong light\nHigh scream when I hit her with the long pipe\nMmm, ice cream when I hit her with the sweet thang\nDo my thing, no, I do not do speaking\nGet my shot, point it out like Ruth, man\nI'ma win a bitch and I got a mood swing\nI'm the realest, bitch, now I got a mood swing\nI got bipolar confidence\nWake up like \"shit\" then I feel like the shit\nSo I guess I'm the shit\nYeah, guess I'm the shit\n\n\nKeep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\nKeep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\n(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\n(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\n\n\nGrab life by the horns when I whip the Lambo\nBlack on red like I whip the sambo\nClip's so long it'll make you mambo\nWatch you tango, dutty wine\nShe grind on my dick like a hundred times\nShawty love me long when I grip her sides\nAnd slip inside like a Slip 'N Slide\nMy electric eel do electric slide but\u2014\nI just wanna feel on the booty\nAll on me, all on me, all on me\nMake it slow clap like Rudy!\nAll on me, all on me, all on me\nI just wanna feel on your booty\nGrab the camcorder, we can make it a movie\nBring a friend with you if you like how I do it\nGold chain swingin' and she like how I shoot it\n\n\nKeep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\nKeep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\n(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\n(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\n\n\nDamn, damn, I'm frosty\nBlood diamond, I'm flossing\nNavy camo, I'm drowning\nBut you don't see what it cost me\nTurmoil like the Saudi's, hand-me-downs never fit me\nParty never fit me, punani never fit me\nDamn, time-travelin', Honda-swervin', that's so Merlyn\nThat's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn\nDamn, time-travelin', Honda-swervin', book learnin'\nThat's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn\n\n\nSwan dive down the 405\nLand at the bottom of El Toro High\nWith the precision of a cut from a Zorro knife\nThe boy spit like he made out of 409\nSo that's clean, bitch\nYou can't play with my team, bitch\nWe rock pink now on Wednesdays\nGreen looks good with your envy\nMix with white 'cause you salty but this stainless\nI'm like platinum and it's painless\nI just skip on the beat like I'm Pee-Wee Herman\nHands up for all my sermons\nMy wheel's turnin', now I'm more efficient than ever\nI feel like Ratatouille when I'm whipping that cheddar\nYou see, you better find your thickest of sweaters\n'Cause this ice might fuck around and change your whole life\n'Cause we about to take flight\n\n\nKeep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\nKeep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\n(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\n(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck\nFly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect\n\n\nKeep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)\nI keep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)\nKeep a gold chain (I said I keep a, gold chain)\nKeep a gold chain (I keep a gold chain)\nKeep a gold chain (I said I keep a, I said I keep a)\n(I keep a gold chain, a gold chain)\nKeep a gold chain\n(I said I keep a, I keep a)\nKeep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)"

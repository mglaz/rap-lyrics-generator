        "\nWho got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it\nTell me why, tell me why\nWho got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it\nTell me why, tell me why (Why?)\n\n\nPhone ringin', never outgoin', homebody\nNever outgoin', put my doubts on when these walls up\nTearing at the black tie, finish addin' notches to my belt loop\nThey say help you, I can't help you\nWhy I can't speak out? Is wideout, wideout\nKeep it deep inside my mind, it's off-kilter, off-kilter\nI turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck\nTime machine gonna make it better, maybe better for ya\nI can't make this up, I can't take it back\nFeel like a monster, feel like a deadhead zombie\nFeelings you don't want me, I ain't givin' up, you should set it off\nTell me \u201cTime's up,\u201d let the water run, let my body run\n\n\nWho got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it\nTell me why, tell me why\nWho got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it\nTell me why, tell me why (Why?)\n\n\nSaid she wanna get high off a nigga\nI wanna die durin' sex or religion\nGod and pussy only know my intentions\nWaking on the tour bus then I'm swimmin'\nYou'd be hurtin' if you trust me but you isn't\nHonestly, that's probably the right decision\nPick up, listen, if you wanna get rich\nNo sleep, how real bad man wake up\n\n\nI found false hope in all kinda places\nHotel rooms and temporary feelings\nI put my clothes on and try to check out\nI try to hide from the sun, let it set now\nDon't let God see me, I got a lot of demons\nAnd I've been sleepin' with 'em\nAnd now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinkin' deeper with 'em\nI'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it\n\n\nThey said \u201cDo you make mistakes or do you make a change?\"\nOr \"Do you draw the line for when it's better days?\u201d\nYou taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame\nI wonder who's to blame\nThey ask me \u201cDo you make mistakes or do you make a change?\"\nOr \"Do you draw the line for when it's better days?\u201d\nWe taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame\nI wonder who's to blame\n\n\nWho got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it\nTell me why, tell me why\nWho got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it\nTell me why, tell me why (Why?)\n\n\nEverything I have (Is a mirror)\nAnd everywhere I stand (Isn't solid ground)\nPeople don't make sense (To me anymore)\nI'm hiding out, again, tryna figure it out, yeah\nI'm tryna figure it out, uh\nI'm tryna figure it out, yeah\nI'm tryna figure it out\nI forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky\nI forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky\nI forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky\nI forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky\n\n\nEverything you wear, I'll be the one to care\nSoftly, you braid your hair, all the angels stare, yeah\nTell me why, tell me why (Why?)"

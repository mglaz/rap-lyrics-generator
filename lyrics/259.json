        "\nSon, you know why you the greatest alive?\nWhy, Dad?\nBecause you came out of my balls, nigga\nHahahahahaha\n(Roof!)\n\n\nFuck rap\nBustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic\nWho done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back\nHold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive\nLeave a suicide note, fuck that\nBobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this\nI'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby\nI'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady with rabies\n\n\nI'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out\nEvery single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about\nAnd I dare you to test me\n'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me\nAnd maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration\nBut I'm full of innovation\nAnd I'm tired of all of this high school \"He's cool, he's not\" rap shit\nCan a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit\nNo, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame\nNowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame\nLike a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em\nKnow you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself\nYeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself\nMass murder like this can't be good for my health\nWhen I rap like this, do I sound like shit?\nWell, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit\nYeah, I'm killin' this shit\nOh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit\nBobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?\nFind another rhyme, goddamn, nigga, shit\n\n\nFuck rap\nBustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic\nWho done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back\nHold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive\nLeave a suicide note, fuck that\nBobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this\nI'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby\nI'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika-chika\nChika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady\n\n\nThere's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide\nHit 'em with that (Do-do-do) and they die\nWe gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide\nI got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes\nNo, we ain't fuckin' with that\nYeah, there's a time and a place\nBut if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps\nCallin' yourself the greatest alive\nThen you don't deserve to do that\nNo, no, oh no, no, please do not do that\nYou gon' get smacked\nYou gon' make Bobby attack\nYou gon' make Bobby Boy snap\nYou gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)\n\n\nFuck rap\nBustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic\nWho done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back\nHold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive\nLeave a suicide note, fuck that\nBobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this\nI'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby\nI'm feelin' like I'm chika-chika-chika-chika\nChika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady\n\n\nJigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z\nJig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything\nAre getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing\nYoung Hova, I know hitters like Yankees\nGun toters that pull triggers like crazy\nUnloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover\nYour body goes limp and slumps over\nLike A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered\nHol' up, I said \"Rover\" because now your Rover is red\nLike Red Rover, so you know what I meant\nBut I roll over my opponents instead\nMakin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down\nI'll go slow for the speds\nBut when I go (Roof!) like the Dobermann said\nI still think the (Roof!) would go over your head (Ha-ha)\nBeast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit\nWith so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw\nFigured it was about time for people to eat crow\nYou about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?\nI stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes\nFrom the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T\nWho the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though\n'Cause MCs know\nBut you don't wanna hear me spit the facts\nYour shit is ass like a tailbone\nOr you're trapped in your cell phone\nOr my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe\nI don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote\nUsed to get beat up by the big kids\nUsed to let the big kids steal my big wheel\nAnd I wouldn't do shit but just sit still\nNow money's not a big deal\nI'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'\nBig bills like a platypus\nA caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis\nI'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'\nBatterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate\nMan, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin\nAnd I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again\nA handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back\nAnd not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap\nI sound like a fuckin' millionaire\nWith a Derringer with a hair trigger\n'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper\nY'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil\nWhen I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct\nI'm 'bout to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it\nI'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket\nAbraca-fuckin'-dabra\nThe track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it\nWhat? Dracula, fuck that shit\nI'm up, back with a thud\nMan, stop\n\n\nLook what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to\nDo all this while ya panickin'\nAnd you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins\nAnd I'm goin' to Fanagans\nTrying to get up a plan against\nAll of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans\nWhile of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana\nYou're in a cab-\nI'm in a cabana and a Janet\nI'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter\nWhile you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina\nYou're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford\nAnd I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards\nWhile I'm world tourin'\nYou usin' way too many napkins, papkins\nLapkins and chapki-\nYou using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'\nFlappin' around like a bapkin'\nFlamminababbitapannitajampkin\nDammit, a can of pada-"

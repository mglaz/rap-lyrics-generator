(Thank you!)\nVelour jumpsuit and some house slippers\nDookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'\nThey had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard\nI bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board\nHello, hello, my ace man, my mellow\nJohn Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no\nI could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those\nThe sneaker heads would be like, \"Ah, he got the Velcros\"\n\n\nI'm gonna pop some tags\nOnly got 20 dollars in my pocket\nI'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up\nThis is fucking awesome\nI'm gonna pop some tags\nOnly got 20 dollars in my pocket\nI'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up\nThis is fucking awesome\n\n\nWhat you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?\nWhat you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?\nI'm diggin', I'm diggin'\nI'm searchin' right through that luggage\nOne man's trash, that's another man's come up\nThank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-\nup shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in hurr stuntin'\nI'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins\nI'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Mens)\nYour grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy\nI'll take those flannel zebra jammies\nSecond hand and I'll rock that, motherfucker\nThe built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker\nI hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker\nThey be like, \"Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight\"\nI'm like, \"Yo, that's 50 dollars for a T-shirt\"\nLimited edition, let's do some simple addition\n50 dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit\nI call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit\nI call that getting tricked by business\nThat shirt's hella dough\nAnd having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't\nPeep game, come take a look through my telescope\nTryna get girls from a brand?\nMan, you hella won't!

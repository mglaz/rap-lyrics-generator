        "\nAll these bitches hate you\nThis is something I know\nBecause you're real enough to give it up\nThere ain't nothing wrong with groupie love\nYou're the only one I notice\nIt's really hard for me to focus, yeah\n'Cuz my body so numb\nAll I do is kill pain\nAll I do is smoke loud\nPut you niggas to shame\nI be rolling all day, mix it in the champagne\nAnd these bottles all free, not a single drink paid\nBecause they want me, they want me in their club\nBut if you got the numbers I'll be glad to show you love\n'Cuz, baby, I'm an XO nigga coming up\nEvery time they play my song I'mma fill another cup\n'Cuz I'm down for whatever I can always keep it up\nAll I need is some liquor just to keep a nigga up, oh yeah\n\n\nI'm gifted when I'm faded\nI'm faded all the time\nBecause I know that's when they love me\nThey love me when I'm high\nWhen they love me\nI get money, I get money, I get money\nWhen they love me\nI get money, I get money, I get money\nSaid, I'm gifted when I'm faded\nI'm faded all the time\nBecause I know that's when they love me\nThey love me when I'm high\nWhen they love me\nI get money, I get money, I get money\nWhen they love me\nI get money, I get money, I get money, oh\n\n\nI be gifted when I'm faded, faded all the time\nThought they loved me when I made it\nNiggas hated all the time, it's a dirty game\nTry to find a bitch, maybe get married\nThat's like pissin' in a freezer, trying to make canaries\nHawk vision, LA heels right on Puff Terrace\nMaking wishes, now I'm french kissing your bitch in Paris\nCome and find me Da Gianni's that's from '92\nHeard you spoil her ass when I bought her a number two\nDipping and you know it, I be pimpin like I owe it\nCome and find me now, I got an army with me now\nTurn your brains oodles and noodles\nFor thinking you got a screw loose\nI tighten you up, them coroners will button you up\n\n\nI'm gifted when I'm faded\nI'm faded all the time\nBecause I know that's when they love me\nThey love me when I'm high\nWhen they love me\nI get money, I get money, I get money\nWhen they love me\nI get money, I get money, I get money\nSaid, I'm gifted when I'm faded\nI'm faded all the time\nBecause I know that's when they love me\nThey love me when I'm high\nWhen they love me\nI get money, I get money, I get money\nWhen they love me\nI get money, I get money, I get money, oh\n\n\nAy, Tony Montana on his last batch\nThis that Wayne Gretzky on his last scratch\nThis that Derek Jeter on his last catch\nThis that Whitney Houston on her last track\nThis that Tiger Woods on his last swing\nThis that Jimi Hendrix on his last string\nThis that Larry Davis on his last bang\nYou can call me Hugh Hefner on his last fling\n\n\nI'm gifted when I'm faded\nI'm faded all the time\nBecause I know that's when they love me\nThey love me when I'm high\nWhen they love me\nI get money, I get money, I get money\nWhen they love me\nI get money, I get money, I get money\nSaid, I'm gifted when I'm faded\nI'm faded all the time\nBecause I know that's when they love me\nThey love me when I'm high\nWhen they love me\nI get money, I get money, I get money\nWhen they love me\nI get money, I get money, I get money, oh"

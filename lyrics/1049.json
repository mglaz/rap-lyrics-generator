        "\nI said, I wanna start this battle sayin' \"I apologize\nI'm sorry Math. I fucked up. Bottom line\nI failed you as a gangsta. It was hard, I really tried\nBut I got tired of wearin' them big ass clothes and I couldn't smile.\"\nYou asked when I changed, February 14, 2014 I had a child\nSo I'm sorry Math, it's over it's done\nLoyalty Over Money, to Math means puttin' Math over my son\nIt's dumb\nBut you gon' stand up here and say I ain't do right by you\nCause I seen shit goin' left and skkkkrt, made a right by you\nNow I gotta sit up here and listen to disses that write by you?\nRight\nBy you approachin' me in Houston I could've found the right bayou\nTo leave you in with Dizaster right by you!\nY'all both ugly 'bout that fight my dude\nBut it wasn't until he battled in Toronto\nI said, \"Oh, time to intervene. It's on the east coast. Cortez on the card. You gon' be with the team.\"\nIt's by home and ironically that fits the scheme\nCause Diz was in the strike zone and you didn't swing\nYou've been playin' this tough shit for over ten years my nigga, that's what you really get\nAccept your karma, it was a Dose of somethin' Serius!\nLittle bitch, little bitch, little bitch, little bitch\nI know when you like when I steal ya shit\nCause that's exactly how you been actin' ever since Dizaster when in ya shit\nI'm feelin' Wavy and me no like\nThat beefs so old it got e.coli\nBut Math hold, he still wanna rap beef\nMath old, he still come to events actin' super street\nSo when I found out I had to do this, a tear almost ran past my cheek\nCause when ya dawg get old...you gotta put his ass to sleep\nSo fuck Math, you ain't gotta be my friend Math\nYou 'bout to get 3 by 10, and after this I'ma be locked in a 3 by 10\nI know the measurements off but y'all ain't never seen my pen'\nI'm with all of the action, once I level up, if ya bars isn't matchin'\nIt's guaranteed to get ugly, that's just the law of attraction\nNigga this how you talk to a has-been\nAye Math, is it lonely down there?\nHe like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\nEverybody call Hollow the GOAT, Goat, goat\"\nIt's not fair boy, before I knew you I did 106, Fight Klub but he think Grind Time how I got here\nWell then think my Illmac battle cause I came in top tier (tear)\nNigga I got a giant Rocket\nSo big Hakeem couldn't try to block it\nOr find an object, cut Math just to make a science project\nThen keep {three stabbing motions} pokin' at him, the knife's obnoxious\nNigga matter of fact, this battle don't make sense to me\nIt's like challenging Daylyt to a spelling bee\nOr seein' ARP seven deep at Born Legacy\nI said {record scratching} let's start takin' it back\nWhat if Jones never ad libbed- {record scratching again}\nLet's start takin' it back\nWhat if Jones never ad libbed while he rapped?\nWhat if Dose never had on a hat?\nWould Math be where he's at?\nAt the bottom of the barrel to scratch\nAll them tails out the barrel to scratch is exactly why you there where you at\nTakin' who cares type of match\nWhile everything they for us (forest) fire, I'm just baring (bearing) the facts\n\"Aye Math!

She's a Ruge'\nWhatever wifey fall short at, my side bitch be geeked to do\nBut wifey? She's just rude\nCause she don't ever say she's hungry, but she'll still reach over and eat ya food\nKeep it cool, cause I would hate to take it further, I would hate to hurt ya\nIn battle rap it's finger guns, nigga outside I raise them burners\nEither way, after killin' yo' ass I might be facin' Murda\nSo let's talk to that nigga\nAyo, I know you buns, but let us (lettuce) get this cheese and may yo (mayo)\nCause rappin' like that, I'll flame that burger\nBut back to you, you ain't a gat tucker or a cap buster\n\n{Argument between the entourages ensues for over two minutes}\n\nBut back to you, you ain't a gat tucker or a cap buster\nSteph and Clay as shooters, how does one dunk make you a Splash Brother?\nDeuce in my boot, I bring it to whatever fool start it\nKnock at ya door, they come out my shoes like you got new carpet\nHollow hit the ground, I'm backin' him down\nNeighbors heard him scream like bitch, thought he was practicin' rounds\nI\u2019m clappin' him now\nCause really, I can't stand all the fake shit\nThis mag (MAGA) will leave your hat red outta hatred\nI say shit, it be deep but it sound so basic\nI said \"MAGA\" \"hat red\", \"hat red\" read out is \"hatred\"\nJust face it\nYou don't got bars like that\nHollow, do you know what \"unilateral\" means?\nNah, you ain't smart like that\nSo try not to fall asleep, you know his bars type wack\nAnd I'll be here next round to bring the bars right back!\n\n\nYou get mad at my cousin but that's a real Blood\nSo if I told him \"Math have to die\" he won't even ask me why\nHe'll just ask the time\nAnd when you hear about the murder know how to act surprised\nLook, I would rebuttal that round, but I wasn't listening half the time\n\n\nYou shoulda!\n\n\nI said before Diz', you had a problem with Smack and you owed that man grands on grands\nShowed no remorse, can't put another man before the man\nGoddamn, you actually got banned before the BANNED\nAnd my man told me, \"Remember who you talkin' to\nA gangsta that get jumped and his response is to sue.\"\nThis is big bad Math?\nThe one that get mad when I fronted you bags\nOf course I made you pump nigga, you ain't never had nothin' on gas\nA Brooklyn nigga with no bread!\nA Brooklyn nigga with no bread!\nA Brooklyn nigga with no bread!\nBut when it come to real drama shit, he fuckin' down\nMath's the type that's a real ass nigga 'til some hoes come around\nThen he's switchin' his aura, this nigga done gained 100 pounds\nWhat a clown\nYou begged me to be in NYB, but at first I didn't truly see\nI was like, \"Down witcha crew? Sweet.\"\nI mean, we knew each other like two weeks\nOn the first week, Math took his course and it was major\nHe's the first rapper to record another rapper askin, \"Are we rappers or are we ?\u201d\nThen he's mad at this rapper for not settin' up another rapper cause you got jumped by a bunch of rappers\nThis all rap shit\nMy nigga we knew each other for a decade and had street dealings\nAin't no flaw in none of that shit\nSo if you gotta say \"Hollow did this\" and \"Hollow did that\" then that's girl shit\nCause if you ain't approach Hollow when he did then it ain't real shit\nBut y'all know what real, to him it's \"Get the 9 (mm) and peel\"\nY'all know what real to me is\nIf ya boy's sittin' inside the cell and don't go to One Time and tell then provide his bail\nThat still applies\nCause real to Math is GS9 lettin' they weapons off\nReal to me is Bobby doin' extra time so Rowdy could get a lesser charge\nBut he gon' say, \"But I ain't never change Hollow, I always kept it real.\"\nAnd that's why I agree witchu, you ain't never change Math, you the same person still\nYou know what you ain't change? Your environment, that's why you never made it out\nYou know what else ain't change? Ya attitude, neither did ya bank account\nHe look at change as somethin' bad so I'ma leave you dead how you are\nY'all remember what he just said? \"I solidify my spot with gorillas...\"\nWhich makes sense cause apes never evolved\nHe walk in a room like, \"I'm Math Hoffa! I rep the crooks!\"\nI walk in the room like, \"I'm Hollow.\" And you wonder why I get better looks\nSee he the type that'll harm somebody for his lack of communication skills\nYou might as well say, \"I kill cause I can't explain the way I feel.\"\nJust like with Tax Stone he was in jail when you dissed him, nigga that's my word\nThat was foul\nBut you got a big check comin' once Tax return\nI said Arian Foster texted me he said, \"Both of y'all my guys\u201d\nSo at the end of the battle give him five\nAnd remember, an updated truth is just as bad as a lie.\"\nThat shit hit town\nI guarantee he watchin' this clip wild\nCause he told me this the other night and I'm rappin' 'bout this shit now!\nSee who legendary Math? When you can switch styles mid-round\nI could've threw in somethin' 'bout Offset and Chris Brown\nBut I'm makin' history, current events ain't how I \u201cGet Down\u201d\nI'm tired of this shit, this is all personal shit\nWhat happened and who's a better lyrically\nBattle rap is startin' to turn into couples therapy\nI remember....it's really becomin' a new sport\nEverybody's peaceful but a few fought\nFour words Math never wanna hear:\n\n\nI'M IN NEW YORK!\n\n\nC'mon Diz'. Yo Diz' come up. Dizaster come up\nLook at you. Look at you. Look at him. He maaaaaad. He maaaaad\n\n\nI\u2019m mad he\u2019s not here, I\u2019m mad he\u2019s not here\nHe wouldn't have made it through the door\n\n\nMath like to go into these stories where he talk real vivid\nAbout meetin' his homie Randy durin' a killin'\nLike, \"I still got the blood on my Timberlands from when I met him.\"\nAnd real niggas listen like, \"Damn, Math out here tellin' all Randy business.\"\nAnd then you ask him what happened he like, \"Oh it was a grimy way\nI had to stake out his house, hide behind the gate.\"\nYou ask Math the time and date he's like, \"It was '98.\"\nThen he say, \"How you gonna  be loyal to yourself?\"\nI'm teachin' self love Math, if you can't be loyal to yourself\nYou can't be loyal to no one else\nI know y'all wonderin' \"Loyalty and business don't mix.\"\nWell I'ma show you how that works\nLike ARP hit me for the Mook battle, what y'all think I did?\nCalled Smack first\nBut Smack can't tell me not to work with you\nCause you paid money to feed my family, see that's where it get personal\nMy personal loyalty is Jim Dutch and Friday cause they hold it down\nMy nigga Jim Dutch I know any day I can hit him like, \"Yo the rent's up.\"\nHe like, \"Here\", that's loyalty over money\nYou gon' respect us and you wanna kick him out the crowd cause you mad\nUnzip that shows that fake LOM, look at him\nThat's what he got on, but I switched it cause I'm dippin' in HiddenLabelClothing.com\n\n\nThat's it?\n\n\nI'm not going 30 minutes. That's five minutes\n\n\nI guess you really do me a favor huh\n\n\nYou're an asshole\n\n\nHe said this battle gon' be \"logic versus emotions\"\nOkay, so let's reverse the stance\nYou rep Loyalty Over Money, being disloyal, don't you hurt your brand?\nBut you said, \"There's no loyalty in business.\"\nAight, you used to serve them grams\nWell hustling's a business, so that tells me at any circumstance\nThat you would even snitch on ya niggas or go and murk ya mans\nAnyway you play it, your logic just ain't worth a damn\nNow loyalty, what's loyalty to you?\nDevotion to something or someone outside yourself\nFeels good knowin' that you got homies to hear your cries for help\nPeople that won't let you die, cause inside they couldn't survive themselves\nA guy to catch you when you backslide, keep you in mind or health\nI told you, \"Stop drinkin' lean\", cause it could take ya life\nI told you, \"Move OT wit' Lennon\", so you could raise him right\nI told you, as far as John John don't even aim to fight\nLet him create the hype and battle that nigga when the paper's right\nFrom the looks of things, nigga I gave you some great advice\nBut let's rewind though, to way before you played this passive shit\nUsed to come to my crib with the gas, a couple of raps to spit\nWe'd talk about life, some nights he even crashed then dipped\nY'all heard him yellin' \"NYB! Nigga that's the clique!\"\nSo what reason was half legit for you to suck Dizaster's dick?\nCause you was on my line like, \"Fuck them niggas, they need to catch a clip.\"\nNow it's karma that I brought on myself? Ain't that a bitch?\nWell I guess the night John John beat yo' ass, karma was movin' fast as shit\nMaybe karma heard about him and Lux and said, \"That match ups sick\nI'ma take the day off, go to this face off, maybe catch a pic.\"\nThen you swung on John and karma whipped out the badge real quick\nAnd gave John John the power to throw you through a glass and crack ya shit\nNah nigga, niggas fight everyday B, that ain't it\nIt was that \u201cBodied\u201d movie, cause DIzaster helped them cast the flick\nYou literally switched up on the set before ya actin' clip\nSeein' ya man work with the ops will really have you pissed\nI ain't wanna clap him, just slap him, bloody his faggot lips\nBut Hollow how could I expect the right aid out of an addict?\nKnowin' you would risk gettin' drugged if someone passed a script\nThis is sad as shit\nThis is sad as shit, cause he was on-line shit poppin'\nDissin' Charlie Clips cause he ain't rockin'\nI'm sittin' back just watchin'\nOh you was mad he had them slippers on like it was wrong, now you the nigga that's flip floppin'?\nIt's just shockin'\nWhat's up wit' ya pride? If you had any issues wit' me nigga, that ain't somethin' you hide\nYou said you could've talked to me, motherfucker you lied\nYa name's Hollow, you not supposed to keep nothin' inside!\n\n{Crowd starts chanting 3-0}\n\nNigga, we was \u201cBoyz N The Hood\u201d them NYB days\nI was Doughboy, a product the streets made\nYou should've been Ricky, cause street wise you need to be sprayed\nBut he jumped out the car in the beef stage\nAnd that's ironic that your actions would show that you would be Tre (betray)\nHollow come on... your whole motto's a con\nYou pushin' loyalty is like the pope preachin' out the Koran\nNiggas thought I was emotional\n\"Oh, oh Math don't know how to move on.\"\nI'ma chess player, I made Hollow a pawn\nI knew if I kept pushin' Hollow eventually Hollow respond\nCause son'll (sun'll) come up early, get it? Hollow Da Don (dawn)\nBut hold on Hollow, I can't lie nigga, your following's strong\nThem niggas will follow you anywhere... except to iTunes to download ya songs\nYou ever heard one of Hollow's songs?\nYo, yo this be the beat, right? Then after Hollow come on\nAnd after awhile this nigga Hollow is GONE\nSo when them pictures of you and Diz' surfaced and they was shoutin' \"You wrong\"\nFor me it wasn't nothin' outta the norm'\nCause I'm used to Hollow losin' track and not ridin' along\nSee y'all see a star\nMe? I only see the clouds that he form\nThey sayin' \"Battle rap's Mook is Jordan and Hollow's Lebron.\"\nNow that's relatable, cause on stage he pull the greatest moves then he play it cool\nBut if you on his team, just know you tradeable\nI felt like Cleveland, in LA niggas made him choose\nThe love is still there, but this chip that I got, really came from you\nMy beef with Dizaster really started with you\nWhen you pressed him in New York and I backed you up cause you was part of the crew\nThey set me up in LA, now you call him your dude?\nHood rules? I'm supposed to break the jaw of this fool\nBut you know what? I'ma chill Hollow\nCause you changed ya life, right?\nOkay, where's the fuckin' evidence?\nYou ain't hangin' wit' me no more so what? You hangin' wit reverends?\nAre you Hollow Da Don the entrepreneur makin' moves for the betterment?\nOr are you a disloyal snake guilty of grand larceny and embezzlement?\nLet's talk about it\nI'd like to introduce y'all to Rob and Duck\nThese are the co-owners of LOM\nThe investors that helped start it up\nNow the irony of all this stuff is Rob and Duck\nAre the two niggas that believed in Hollow before he robbed and ducked\nSee, Hollow was runnin' the company, but he was fuckin' shit up\nNot payin' taxes, just runnin' amok\nSo Rob started checkin' the books thinkin' somethin' was up\nFirst thing he discovers is what?\nIt seems Hollow's cut wasn't enough\nThis fuck boy was stealin' from his partners tryin' to cover it up\nLet's play \u201cSwear To God\u201d Hollow...\nThat Audi that you love to brag about didn't come from Rob\nSwear to God that you not a thief\nSwear to God that you not a rat\nSwear to God it ain't your signature on these paperwork that you stole and you'd pay him back\nSwear to God this ain't the facts\nYou like to talk like you makin' money, well that's cool\nIf none of this is true, take these papers from me\nOkay, we'll just say today you've been served\nFor months you talkin' 'bout you elevated nigga\nHow you elevated nigga? Look how you livin' nigga\nThe first time you stole from 'em you gave 'em your word\nThat you would pay it back so they told you only scrape up a third\nBut that was a mistake, cause they let you outta the trap\nThey ain't realize they was housing a rat\nYou knew where the cheese was and you knew how to come back\nSo when the company started doin' good and makin' mountains of stacks\nHollow turned Thanos and cleaned out the accounts with a snap\nWhat the fuck fuck?!\nNigga how you rob Rob and duck Duck?\nIf you would've stole $50,000 from me, nigga you'd be more than fucked up\nBut this is what you talkin' 'bout? I'm mad at your elevation?\nYou out here stealin' from niggas with families and what? It's a celebration?\nYou didn't even think about the safety of Lennon\nCause if you would've stole from me and I couldn't find you, that's the next place that we headin'\nSo Rob got mad, he just wanted to pop on him\nWent to Florida, pulled up to his crib and got the drop on him\nHollow ran left his sons and his moms to take a shot for him\nThen he called up talkin' tough tellin' Rob to have his Glock on him\nAnd then what you do after that bitch nigga? You called the cops on him\nWhat happened to you man?!\nWhat happened to you bro?\nYou doin' all this frontin', turns out you ain't loyal to nothin'\nBut Loyalty Over Money, that ain't a brand you should rep, nigga you foo foo\nIt's cool dude, cause guess who's the newest partner with you too?\nYeah nigga, I'm makin' it mine\nYou ain't seen the other papers I sign\nSo everything that you doin' now, all the money you makin' is fine\nBut after that court date make sure you make my payments on time\nAnd while you standin' here tryin' to get it all straight in ya mind\nWe already collaborated, y'all can check out LOM's latest design\nBut wait, it's-now it's HiddenLabelClothing, right?\nWith Mike Zombie, who put the bread in nigga?\nOkay you went from pushin' loyalty to a hidden agenda\nI get it nigga\nYo Mike, if you watchin' check your accounts and your credit nigga\nCause chances are he's only workin' with Zombie cause he's so used to deadin' niggas\nLook Hollow, this what you gon' do, right\nYou gon' get them hard workin' brothers back they money and save ya life\nAs far as our relationship goes, if you wanna make it right\nThere's two things you can do: give me DIzaster's home address and tell your sister come to my crib so she can take this pipe\nOther than that, don't be worried what I got on\nBut if you is worried, LOMClothingStore.com\nHoffa!"

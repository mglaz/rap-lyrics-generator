Shorty, what you need?\nMy niggas run the game, we ain't never leavin'\nCountin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'\nYou got V12, I got 12 V's (Skrr!)\nGot bottles, got weed, got molly (Molly!) (I'm all the way up)\nI'm all the way up\nShorty, what you want? I got what you need\nShorty, what you want? I got what you need\nShorty, what you want? I got what you need\n\n\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nAll the way up\nNothing can stop me, I'm all the way up\nTurn me all the way up, Dre!\n\n\nYou know you made it when the fact your marriage made it is worth millions\nLemonade is a popular drink and it still is (woo!)\nSurvival of the littest\nNiggas who really up vers' niggas up in your business\nI'm in the room where real niggas not allowed (woo!)\nI'm the only one in the room that they fear right now (woo!)\nI think they're clear right now\nLet's celebrate, no red Champagne, we don't play that\nAll we see is gold bottles and paper plane hats\n21 Grammys that I use for D'USS\u00c9 cups\nI'm on the penthouse floor, call your way up\nThe OG's say, \"HOV, how high is high enough?\"\nI said, \"Till we eye and eye with the higher-ups\"\nUntil we let 'em know, we ain't those niggas\nUntil our babies showered in gold, nigga\nBlue lookin' like Pac in the tub\nDavid LaChapelle levels of not givin' a fuck\nPrince left his masters where they safe and sound\nWe never gonna let the elevator take us down, aaaahhh!\n\n\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nYo, Pecas! What up, homie?\nI'm all the way up\nNothing can stop me, I'm all the way up\n\n\nThis wasn't me, this was God's doing\nAnd this time I won't finger roll; Pat Ewing\nThey ain't wanna see the Squad and the Roc\nNow they chasin' the Wraith, like Mister Softee's on the block\nStars on the roof got her feelin' like Venus\nGettin' so much brain now I'm a Don CartaGenius\nEver since Pun been gone, been independent\nSo I went and threw the Pun Jumpman up in the pendant\nHa! I flooded out all the Christ's\nOut in Paris, I learned what real ice is\nHee-shee, I'm kickin' flava' in your ear\nI just had a gray on my face and it disappeared\nI just dropped the biggest of checks, and the shit cleared\nWhen everybody counted us out just this year\nUh, I'm Steph Curry in the clutch\nTake a shot of this Royal Elite, and go all the way up!\n\n\nAll the way up\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nNothing can stop me, I'm all the way up\nAll the way up\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nNothing can stop me, I'm all the way up\n\n\nMy swag, my flow, I stole it back\nThey mad, too bad, my shows is packed\nMy town, my crown, I really rap\nI'm home, my throne, I spoil you that\nWhen the bitch was gone, they was really playin' with it\nI was sittin' listenin', like, \"They ain't even sayin' shit!\"\nNow the real is back, I see they all tryna change and shit\nBut it's really too late now, I'm goin' back (Go!)\nOne of these bitches, two of these bitches gotta die\nThree of these bitches, four of these bitches gonna cry\nFive of these bitches poppin' pills, they high\nSix bird bitches, none of them get fly\nSee, I don't wanna hear about your records and big numbers\n\u2018Cause I was up top seven winters and six summers\nCuffed, all in that bus, locked me all the way down\nNow I'm all the way up\n\n\nAll the way up\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nNothing can stop me, I'm all the way up\n\n\nShorty, what you want? Shorty, what you need?\nMy niggas run the game, we ain't never leavin'\nCountin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'\nYou got V12, I got 12 V's (Skrr!)\nGot bottles, got weed, got molly (Molly!) (I'm all the way up)\nI'm all the way up\nShorty, what you want? I got what you need\nShorty, what you want? I got what you need\nShorty, what you want? I got what you need\n\n\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nAll the way up\nNothing can stop me, I'm all the way up"

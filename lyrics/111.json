        "\nOkay, okay, okay, okay\nOkay, okay, oh\n\n\nYou live in my dream state\nRelocate my fantasy\nI stay in reality\nYou live in my dream state\nAny time I count sheep\nThat's the only time we make up, make up\nYou exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids\nNow I don't wanna wake up\n\n\n20/20, 20/20 vision\nCupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I\nWonder if you look both ways\nWhen you cross my mind\nI said, I said\nI'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing\nYou're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I\nI can only see your face when I close my eyes\n\n\nCan I get a kiss?\nAnd can you make it last forever?\nI said I'm 'bout to go to war\nAnd I don't know if I'ma see you again\nCan I get a kiss? (Can I?)\nAnd can you make it last forever? (Can you?)\nI said I'm 'bout to go to war (I'm 'bout to)\nAnd I don't know if I'ma see you again\nUgh, switch it up\n\n\nI said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation\nIs translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)\nOh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you\nI've been looking, stop the waiting\n'Fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic\n\"You don't understand me\", what the fuck do you mean?\nIt's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes\nSugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene\nYeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie\nUugh!\n\n\n20/20, 20/20 vision\nCupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, I\nWonder if you look both ways\nWhen you cross my mind\nI said, I said\nI'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing\nYou're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I\nI can only see your face when I close my eyes\n(So)\n\n\nCan I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)\nAnd can you make it last forever? (Make it last forever)\nI said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to go to war)\nI don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)\nCan I get a kiss? (Can I?)\nAnd can you make it last forever? (Can you?)\nI said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)\nAnd I don't know if I'ma see you again\n\n\nOkay, okay, okay, okay\nOkay, okay, okay, oh\nLa la, la la la la, la la\nLa la, la la la, la la\nOkay, okay, okay, okay\nOkay, okay, okay, oh\nLa la, la la la la, la la\nLa la, la la la la\nOne more time?"

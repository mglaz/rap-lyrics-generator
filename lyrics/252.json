        "\nI got 99 problems and they all bitches\nWish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'\nBut I'm not Shawn, or Martin Louis\nI'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys\nYou knowin' how it be when you start living large\nI control my own life, Charles was never in charge\nNo sitcom could teach Scott about the dram\nOr even explain the troubles that haunted my mom\nOn Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind\nGot me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh?\nShe copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself\n\"Why he by himself?\"\nHe got two older brothers, one hood, one good\nAn independent older sister kept me fly when she could\nBut they all didn't see\nThe little bit of sadness in me\nScotty\n\n\nI've got some issues that nobody can see\nAnd all of these emotions are pouring out of me\nI bring them to the light for you, it's only right\nThis is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life\n\n\nI'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense\nSince my father died, I ain't been right since\nAnd I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe\nSplit an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe\nI try and think about myself as a sacrifice\nJust to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night\nThe moon will illuminate my room and soon I'm consumed by my doom\nOnce upon a time nobody gave a fuck\nIt's all said and done and my cock's been sucked\nSo now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound\nMy heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon\nI live in a cocoon opposite of Canc\u00fan\nWhere it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon\nSo it's more than right, I try and shed some light on a man\nNot many people of this planet understand fame\n\n\nI've got some issues that nobody can see\nAnd all of these emotions are pouring out of me\nI bring them to the light for you, it's only right\nThis is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life\n\n\nI'm this close to go and trying some coke\nAnd a happy ending would be slittin' my throat\nIgnorance to cope man, ignorance is bliss\nIgnorance is love and I need that shit\nIf I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth\nIf I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass\nDon't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam\nHaters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck\nHope I really get to see 30\nWanna settle down, stop being so flirty\nMost of the clean faces be the most dirty\nI just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry\nAss all chunky, brain is insanity\nOnly things that calm me down: pussy and some Cali tree\nAnd I get both, never truly satisfied\nI am happy, that's just the saddest lie\n\n\nI've got some issues that nobody can see\nAnd all of these emotions are pouring out of me\nI bring them to the light for you, it's only right\nThis is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life\n\n\nTo my life, to my life, to my life\u2026\nUh\nYeah, uh-huh\nYeah, uh-huh\nYeah, uh-huh\nYeah, uh-huh\nYeah\nYeah\nYeah"

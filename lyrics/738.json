        "\nAba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nMhmm, mhmm, mhmm\n\n\nOh, I swam for miles, only to realize the current\nIs fightin' against me and I'm so tired, I'm floatin' now\nOh, from here on out, I've got to realize the power\nOf learnin' to let go, and just let God\nEnjoy the ride\n\n\nYeah, look\nBorn into pain, alcoholic veins\nOver-analytical brain a product of the shame\nAnd runnin' from a past, that's checkered like the game\nSomewhere 'long the way somebody snatched my peace and main\nMaybe that's the reason I spent decades seekin' fame\nAnd fortune hopin' that a proper portion would contain\nThe sadness in my eyes, remember when I came\nIn this music business, all their questions was insane\n\"Why you never smile in your pictures?\" I refrain\nFrom givin' you the answer 'cause that answer wasn't plain\nEnough for me to see 'cause at the time I knew my name\nBut didn't know myself, and so I dealt with shit the same\nAs a fugitive, but running from the truth and shit\nI shoot the shit with niggas, but they never knew the shit that's hidden deep\nWithin the crevices like ever since I was a child\nSeen my mama with the pistol pointed at her dome and how\nIn the fuck do you expect for me to ever be the best lil' me\nThat I can be, when trauma's deep inside of me, like I.V. fluid Pumpin' through the blood of wifey, while she's givin' birth\nTo my child, I know my thoughts are runnin' wild\nBear with my style, this just a trial run\nJust heard these kids don't know 'bout Malcolm\nAnd I'm sort of heartbroken 'cause the elders lost hope in our youth\nAnd here I sit dead in the middle, not a little boy no more\nBut not quite old yet, wakin' up in cold sweats\nScared that I'm too disconnected from the kids' perspective\nThe world ain't got no patience for some shit that's introspective So where in the fuck that leave me? Irrelevant, I guess\nWent from Heaven-sent to hella bent, intelligent but stressed, damn\n\n\nOh, I swam for miles, only to realize the current\nIs fightin' against me and I'm so tired, I'm floatin' now\nOh, from here on out, I've got to realize the power\nOf learnin' to let go, and just let God\nEnjoy the ride\n\n\nOne more time\nSwim good, enjoy the ride (Yeah)\nEvery day I rise, thank God that I am alive (Yeah)\nYeah, swim good, enjoy the ride (Yeah)\nEvery day I rise, thank God that I am alive (Uh)\n\n\nPermanent vacation for forever\nSome things you gotta leave behind, some people just like weather\nAnd seasons, for that reason, I know I'll always have a leg up\nWeatherman forecast me dead last, think I'm just another nigga\nMaybe, I'll be the next Black Beatle like Swae Lee\nYeah, I know my worth, these colonizers got to pay me\nYeah, I had to go first 'cause the rest would never last\nI had to show the positives for those that couldn't add\nLookin' at the ads, they only love us if our ass\nOut and so I'm out, I got an Audi and it's bad\nI said that line 'cause niggas only respect you if you brag\nIt don't work on me the same, don't give a fuck 'bout what you have\nEverybody claimin' boss, none of you niggas got no staff\nIt don't measure up the same, what's a quarter to a half?\nOf a whole lot of problems, nigga, who taught you to add?\nWhere I'm from, we don't recognize that it's good math\nIf you don't teach the ones that's comin' up to multiply their cash\nThink for themselves, think beyond sales\nEverything with worth don't come with some whistles and some bells\nThe ones I gotta leave behind, the ones you gotta bail\nMeek Mill, I'm workin' hard, ain't too far from a meek mil'\nTo keep it real, the realest niggas I know always kept it real\nAnd I'ma tell you, Black-on-Black murder been whack\n9th, turn me up so they can hear me in the back\nYeah, and that's pretty hard for me\nBut you see hopeful niggas and where they all ought to be\nScared to grow wings, Birdman with a bunch of Carter beef\nThat's old news, look, nigga, you talkin' to modern me\nSmarter, we had better conversations sittin' with barbers\nPuttin' hearts and heads in niggas who don't think ahead, who taught you?\nSchool y'all, school y'all, welcome to the schoolyard\nTeach you how to make moves without needin' a U-HAUL\nI was on you all when I was growin' up\nNow it's you all that's all on these nuts\nI'm ballin', havin' a ball and I got the balls to say it\nWho needs inspiration where you know when you can play it?\nCarolina to the heart, nobody here gon' play us\nThe day that we expire, Carolina's where they'll lay us\nI woke up feelin' like Aaliyah, yeah, a million and one bucks\nTold these niggas I don't give a single million and one fuck, Rap\n\n\nOh, I swam for miles, only to realize the current\nIs fightin' against me and I'm so tired, I'm floatin' now\nOh, from here on out, I've got to realize the power\nOf learnin' to let go, and just let God\nEnjoy the ride"

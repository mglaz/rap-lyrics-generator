        "\nJust stop your crying, it's a sign of the times\nWelcome to the final show\nHope you're wearing your best clothes\nYou can't bribe the door on your way to the sky\nYou look pretty good down here\nBut you ain't really good\n\n\nWe never learn, we been here before\nWhy are we always stuck and running from\nThe bullets? The bullets?\nWe never learn, we been here before\nWhy are we always stuck and running from\nThe bullets? The bullets?\n\n\nJust stop your crying, it's a sign of the times\nWe gotta get away from here\nWe gotta get away from here\nJust stop your crying, it'll be alright\nThey told me that the end is near\nWe gotta get away from here\n\n\nJust stop your crying, have the time of your life\nBreaking through the atmosphere\nAnd things are pretty good from here\nRemember everything will be alright\nWe can meet again somewhere\nSomewhere far away from here\n\n\nWe never learn, we been here before\nWhy are we always stuck and running from\nThe bullets? The bullets?\nWe never learn, we been here before\nWhy are we always stuck and running from\nThe bullets? The bullets?\n\n\nJust stop your crying, it's a sign of the times\nWe gotta get away from here\nWe gotta get away from here\nStop your crying, baby, it'll be alright\nThey told me that the end is near\nWe gotta get away from here\n\n\nWe never learn, we been here before\nWhy are we always stuck and running from\nThe bullets? The bullets?\nWe never learn, we been here before\nWhy are we always stuck and running from\nThe bullets? The bullets?\n\n\nWe don't talk enough, we should open up\nBefore it's all too much\nWill we ever learn? We've been here before\nIt's just what we know\n\n\nStop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times\nWe gotta get away, we got to get away\nWe got to get away, we got to get away\nWe got to get away\nWe got to, we got to, away\nWe got to, we got to, away\nWe got to, we got to, away"

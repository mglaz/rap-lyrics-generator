        "\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\nIt seems like blessings keep falling in my lap\nIt seems like blessings keep falling in my lap\n\n\nI don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom\nDon't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom\nChisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air\nDying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair\nJesus' black life ain't matter, I know, I talked to his daddy\nSaid you the man of the house now, look out for your family\nHe has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest\nAnd gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath\n\n\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone (Don't be mad)\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone\nWhen the praises go up (Good God)\nThe blessings come down, Good God\nWhen the praises go up (Good God) the blessings come down\n(The blessings come down)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap)\nThe blessings come down\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(Good God)\n\n\nThey booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor\nWith the big wide windows, with the suicide doors\nAin't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven\nI know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven\nI know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions\nLike my ex-girl getting pregnant\nAnd her becoming my everything\nI'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs\nI never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled\nThey want four-minute songs\nYou need a four-hour praise dance performed every morn\nI'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn\nHit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter\nWatch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh\n(Good God)\n\n\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone\n(Good God)\nI'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone\nWhen the praises go up, (Good God) the blessings come down\n(The blessings come down)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(The blessings come down)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(Are you ready for your blessings?)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n(Are you ready for your miracle?)\nWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down\n\n\nAre you ready, are you ready?\nAre you ready, are you ready?\nAre you ready, are you ready?\nAre you ready, are you ready?\nAre you ready, are you ready?\nIt seems like blessings keep falling in my lap"

        "\nMust've been crazy to think that you loved me\nI saw all the signs but I just couldn't say nothing\nI did the time across the line for you\n'Cause I can't see myself with nobody else but you\nTell me what you're thinking 'cause this is what you wanted\nShould've been the one to hold me when I got lonely\n'Cause every time I think of the lies you told to me\nMake it easy for me to leave\n\n\nYou plus me was a love lesson\nIn too deep without imperfection\nNot always good, but I stayed on my feet\nYou had me, should've never questioned\nYou plus me was a love lesson\nIn too deep without imperfection\nNot always good, but I stayed on my feet\nYou had me, should've never questioned\nYou plus me\nYou plus me\nYou plus me\n\n\nOh, I was ridin' wherever you going\nAt times, I wanted to leave, but didn't wanna be lonely\nCan't deny the fact you were my one and only\nLove that I would do, only love I knew\nAnd now I gotta turn my back 'cause you didn't realize that, boy\nThis was a real thing\nAnd I just can't deny the fact we don't belong together\nGuess it ain't the real thing\n\n\nYou plus me was a love lesson\nIn too deep without imperfection\nNot always good, but I stayed on my feet\nYou had me, should've never questioned\nYou plus me was a love lesson\nIn too deep without imperfection\nNot always good, but I stayed on my feet\nYou had me, should've never questioned\nYou plus me\nYou plus me\nYou plus me\n\n\nGotta keep on pushing and love myself through the hard times\nGotta keep my patience, still a long way to go now\nThere's so much to learn\nWhen we trust the love that's deep in us\nThen love will return (yes, it will)\nBoy this thing was, a love lesson\n\n\nYou plus me was a love lesson\nIn too deep without imperfection\nNot always good, but I stayed on my feet\nYou had me, should've never questioned\nYou plus me was a love lesson\nIn too deep without imperfection\nNot always good, but I stayed on my feet\nYou had me, should've never questioned\nYou plus me\n\n\nYou plus me\nYou plus me\nYou plus me\nYou plus me\nYou plus me"

        "\nYou niggas don\u2019t even know\nAll that talk then no show\nCannot tell me nothin'\nShow me somethin' I ain't seen before\nThat hoe want my piccolo\nSmoking on that mistletoe\nMake her kiss all on it\nWhile we chop chop on them 24s\nShe look like a centerfold\nMouth all on my genitals\nSuckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals\nI be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles\nPoke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules\nRolling up them vegetables\nRapping with that special flow\nOnly way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4\nI be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show\nUsed to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe\nNow I sell out all my shows\nUsed to sell out all my blow\nThat was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll up 4\nNow a nigga livin' good\nI done made it out the hood\nThink I'm goin' back?\nI wish a motherfucker would\n\n\nYeah, they say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\nThey say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\n\n\nStill wicked as Aleister, Crowley niggas know me well\nFor heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell\nWhen you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny\nI'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail\nSecond grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch\nTo show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail\nGrounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck\nEmployer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer\nWith ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I don't even want, the Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah)\nGivenchy bikers with the rev rips\nBalmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick\nPaid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips\nSoulo Ho3 the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition\nOh yeah, now a nigga livin' good\nBut good could be better I wish a motherfucker would\n\n\nYeah, they say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\nThey say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\n\n\nLife is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya\nLife to end in vain before the end is near\nSee I can hear you crying\nSilence sittin' in the dark\nHoldin' crosses 'cross your heart\nSin is such a work of art\nWatch out for the love lost\n\n\nBet a thousand, shoot a thousand\nThings a nigga do for thousands\nMade a million counting sheep\nGave it all to public housin'\nTaking off to Abu Dhabi\nBeamin' up the motor, Scotty\nTalking to promoters, Scotty\nEverybody know it's Gotti\nMurder one, you've heard of them\nThe rev undid, the all day madness\nGot it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress\nBig power, big stages\nMy zoo cannot fit the cages\nThis booth is not used to fakin'\nMy crew just love confrontation\nI chewed the face off the laces\nI moved the weight from the waitress\nI chef the pot that made poison\nI cooked then kicked all the patients\nMy bitch is way beyond basic\nThat's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance\nAyy, look what we're enduring\nAyy, ridin' in foreigns\nAyy, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch\nBut it's the real watch and that bitch fire\nSpeed Racer waitin' outside\nThe roof on it like a tank top\nCountin' money, watchin' paint dry\nWhen I'm done is when the rain stops, uh\n\n\nThey say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\nThey say I got the city on fire\nI ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah\nReally doe, like really doe\nReally doe, like really doe\n\n\nGood, hood\nI wish you motherfuckin' would\nListen, wish a motherfucker would, Brown\nI had to put my foot down\nIt's like I'm popping a clutch\nYour hate palpable, your jaw full of dust\nYou gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?\nAnd I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge\nYou a mouse that the falcon picked up\nSo disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month\nI was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck\nAnd I never pass my mama no blunt\nAnd kept my head straight\nListen deadweight never been a problem to dunk\nLook, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough\nI keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff\nI strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club\nI wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must\nIt's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs\nEither that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks\nLoungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts\nYou've been the same motherfucker since 2001\nWell it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump\nI'm at your house like, \"Why you got your couch on my Chucks?\"\nMotherfucker"

        "\nI torture you\nTake my hand through the flames\nI torture you\nI'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)\nI wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down\nOooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain\n\n\nDolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain\nI got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles\nPressure from the man got us all in rebellion\nWe gon' go to war, yeah, without failure\nDo it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog\nLove and the loyalty that's what we stand for\nAlienated by society\nAll this pressure give me anxiety\nWalk slow through the fire\nLike, who gon' try us?\nFeeling the world go against us\nSo we put the world on our shoulders\n\n\nI torture you\nTake my hand through the flames\nI torture you\nI'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)\nI wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down\nOooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain\n\n\nI been at it with my homies, it don't matter, you don't know me\nI been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene\nI been riding 'round the city with my squad\nI been riding 'round the city with my, squad\nWe just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing\nHold up, take a step back when we roll up cause I know what\nWe been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in\nWon't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion\nI know I been bussin', no discussion for my family\nNo hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy\nLike what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up\nYes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up\n\n\nI torture you\nTake my hand through the flames\nI torture you\nI'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)\nI wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down\nOooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain\n\n\nUhh, devoted to destruction\nA full dosage of detrimental dysfunction\nI'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me\nSee, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy\nMight cut my head off right after I slit my throat\nTongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat\nEating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast\nAnd if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke\nLike I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole\nThat's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul\nAnd only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads\nSo I don't fear shit but tomorrow\nAnd I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain\nYou just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim\nJust stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne\nI'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train\n'Cause I'm a sucker for pain\n\n\nUsed to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it\nAin't got no other way so we start it and finish it\nNo pain, no gain\nNever stand down, made our own way\nNever going slow, we pick up the pace\nThis is what we wanted from a young age\nNo emotion, that's what business is\nLord have mercy on the witnesses\n\n\nI torture you\nTake my hand through the flames\nI torture you\nI'm just a sucker for pain\n\n\nMore pain\nGot me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'\nFor more pain\nGot me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'\nFor more pain\nGot me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'\nFor more pain\nGot me beggin'..."

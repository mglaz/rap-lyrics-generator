        "\nGolden rubbers in these denim pockets (Denim pockets)\nOn my waist, there's a black Glock (Black Glock)\nNew girl moved on the block (On the block)\nShe been plottin' on my brown cock (Brown cock)\nLast night I slept over hers (Over hers)\nDuring sex, I overheard (I overheard)\nA sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na\nRolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow\nBlood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash\nLooked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass\nA real ninja, with the blade and the mask\nHad them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks\nNow she tryna patch me up, but\nGirl, I was just tryna get a nut bust\nIf that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol\nBut I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude\n\n\nThe blinds wide open so he can\nSee you in the dark when you're sleepin'\nNaked body, fresh out the shower\nYou touch yourself after hours\nAin't no man allowed in your bedroom\nYou're sleeping alone in bed\nBut check your window (Swag)\nHe's at your window\n\n\nNight light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites\nI'm a down to Earth nigga with intentions that's right\nYou'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight\nBut I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight\nWe can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck\nYou can tell me all your problems like I really give one (Nope)\nBut I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want\nDon't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy\nSee when I'm with my friends I just put on a front\nBut in the back of my top, I'm writing songs about we\nWe, as including I, and yourself, making three\nLittle ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me\nYou're a pretty broad in the top three\nOf things that I've been waiting to come, so\nMeet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then\nWe can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time\n\n\nThe blinds wide open so he can\nSee you in the dark when you're sleepin'\nNaked body, fresh out the shower\nYou touch yourself after hours\nAin't no man allowed in your bedroom\nYou're sleeping alone in bed\nBut check your window\nHe's at your window\n\n\nOne, two; you're the girl that I want\nThree, four, five, six, seven; shit\nEight is the bullets if you say no after all this\nAnd I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous\nGorgeous, baby you're gorgeous\nI just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest\nAnd fornicate with it\nBut that's because I'm in love with you, cunt\n\n\nI just wanna talk, and conversate\n'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate\nAnd I finally got the courage to ask you on a date\nSo just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt)\nI just wanna talk and conversate\n'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate\nAnd I finally got the courage to ask you on a date\nSo just say yes, let the future fall into place, cunt\n\n\nThe blinds wide open so he can\nSee you in the dark when you're sleepin'\nNaked body, fresh out the shower\nYou touch yourself after hours\nAin't no man allowed in your bedroom\nYou're sleeping alone in bed\nBut check your window\nHe's at your window\nThe blinds wide open so he can\nSee you in the dark when you're sleepin'\nNaked body, fresh out the shower\nYou touch yourself after hours\nAin't no man allowed in your bedroom\nYou're sleeping alone in bed\nHe's at your window\n\n\nOne, two; you're the girl that I want\nThree, four, five, six, seven; shit\nEight is the bullets if you say no after all this\nAnd I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous\nGorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous"

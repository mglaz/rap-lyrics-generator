        "\nWoo!!! Yeah!!! Remix!!! (50 Cent: Ha Ha!!!)\nLloyd Banks!!! (Lloyd Banks: Uh Huh!!!) Ha Ha!!!\n\n\nIt's like a throne that he don't even own\nHe won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around\nIt\u2019s like a joke, he\u2019s like a king, but he don\u2019t rule a thing\nHe don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry\nHe don't want the room or want the loot, he's in it for the sport\nRunning circles 'round his competition on the court\nHe appreciates your support, but he ain't begging for it\nAnd you can love it, you can hate it, but you can't ignore it\nYou can't be that ig-nor-ant, though you can try to sell him short\nBut you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it\nAnd he was born to raise hell like them country boys\nAnd if I'm fronting, man, you better come confront me for it\n\n\nThis is the story of a warrior, I know you know it\nTrue warriors go ahead and make some noise\nIt ain't healthy to be making niggas paranoid\nHit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys\nI'm doing a hundred tween in the fast lane\nKick back just relax let me do my thing\nDon't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain\nMoney, power, and respect in this rap game\n\n\nHe's straight outta a neighborhood where niggas hate\nTo see you blow and eat your dinner off a bigger plate\nTheir stomachs ache while he's lounging in the big estate\nAnd he hops in a hundred thousand where the nigga stay, houses with a bigger gate\nHounding him's a big mistake, he won't surrender he'll rather give up a rib to break\nCause he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helping hand\nTill he was sitting on green like a Celtic fan\nCreated a buzz to where you gotta mention his name\nWhen you discussing the illest players that's in the game\nAnd he's riding with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and 'em\nG-Unit Records ain't a motherfucker stopping them\n\n\nThis is the story of a warrior, I know you know it\nTrue warriors go ahead and make some noise\nIt ain't healthy to be making niggas paranoid\nHit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys\nI'm doing a hundred tween in the fast lane\nKick back just relax let me do my thing\nDon't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain\nMoney, power, and respect in this rap game\n\n\nHe's no magician man the kid does something out of nothing\nSo that niggas from his hood act like he owes him something\nThey talk crazy till they send niggas to where to buck him\nAsk him if it's a problem and he'll say \"nah, it's nothing\"\nHe was gonna help 'em out but since they fronted fuck 'em\nHe don't care how they feel they can hate him or love him\nHe held his own on his own the kid is really thugging\nHe's rich now, he ain't changed so niggas think he bugging\nHe bulletproof everything cause niggas try and buck him\nKeeps two pistols on his hip I'll show you where he tuck 'em\nNiggas say they gon' get at him but they can't touch him\nTry to catch him slipping they creep in and he start bussing\n\n\nThis is the story of a warrior, I know you know it\nTrue warriors go ahead and make some noise\nIt ain't healthy to be making niggas paranoid\nHit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys\nI'm doing a hundred tween in the fast lane\nKick back just relax let me do my thing\nDon't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain\nMoney, power, and respect in this rap game\n\n\nI can give you niggas something you can talk about\nI can turn your smile upside down\nYou ain't no G you a fucking clown\nI can take your girl and tu-turn her out\nDon't hold it in let it all out\nI can give you fuckers something to be mad about\nInvite her in send her back out\nWith my DNA all in her mouth"

        "\nShe hit the plane with half a kilo\nShe turned around and said tranquilo\nTomorrow meet me at mi casa\nJust call me when you know que pasa\nI think I'm falling for Consuela\nShe's from the slums of Venezuela\nNo I can't wait until ma\u00f1ana\nI fly and meet you in Havana\nI'm dressed in black just like mi gente\nLike es el dia de la muerte\nShe's only loyal to el jefe\nI bet she taste just like tres leches\n\n\nI think I'm falling for Consuela\nI think I'm falling for Consuela\nI think I'm falling for Consuela\nI think I'm falling for Consuela\n\n\nI gave a 'Rari to my brother (skrt-skrt-skrt)\nI bought a mansion for my mother (for my mother)\nI got like 20s in all colors (xannies and percs)\nI'ma get these hoes just like \nTurned to a boss, start writing checks (writing checks)\nGot 20,000 VV's on my neck (on my neck)\nTurned to a monster, I'm T-Rex\nI'm with your wife, no I don't kiss her, hey\nShe got me running like El Chapo\nI took my other bitch to Cabo\nAll she call me is el jefe\nFeds asking questions, no comprende (no sabe nada)\n\n\nI think I'm falling for Consuela\nI think I'm falling for Consuela\nI think I'm falling for Consuela\nI think I'm falling for Consuela\n\n\nShe love to argue papa fuera\nGave her love but she no quer\u00eda\nShe used to sing guantanamera\nDiamonds dancing, Macarena\nI'm tryna be a caballero\nI think she only love dinero\nShe have some beef and dropped some pesos\nThat's hamburguesa with the queso\n\n\nI think I'm falling for Consuela\nI think I'm falling for Consuela\nI think I'm falling for Consuela\nI think I'm falling for Consuela"

        "\nShout out to Marvin Gaye\nLove you then they hate you\nThen they love you again\nHate you then they love you\nThen they hate you again\n\n\n(Keep giving me love) hold me tight, (and then you take it away) let me go\n(Keep giving me love) heal my heart, (and then you take it away) hurt my soul\n(Keep giving me love)\n\nBuild me up, (and then you take it away)\n break me down\n(Keep giving me love) Make me smile, (and then you take it away) make me frown\n(Keep giving me love)\n\nGive me love, (take it away)\n take it all away again\n(Keep giving me love) Give me love, (and then you take it away) take it all away again\n\n\n\nYeah, ain't no love in the heart of city, that's what they told me\nBeef with over 100 niggas, don't none of 'em know me\nSon of a mother studying at UDC\nSitting in taxi cabs, where daddy roaming the streets\nSeven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean\nOn everything I wear it, all the America's tees\nThis whole system most prolific in the DMV\nListen when you get the keys it's seldom, you don\u2019t get the beef\nMake a nigga wanna get the piece to get to peace\nYou gon' need more than Wikipedia to get to me\nPG to Mo County bet they all know about me\nEvery hood, every 'burb, I got superb balance\nFrom the city that made me love you forever for it\nHope you celebrate every moment forever ignore it\nYou made me what I am, you made me what I'm not\nThey gon' love you a little different when you at the top\n\n\nGive me love, baby\nNot enough, not enough, just a touch, baby\nWhat the fuck, baby? It's just us, baby\nThis ain't right, this is life\nThis a love hate thing\nGive me love, baby\nNot enough, not enough, just a touch, baby\nWhat the fuck, baby? It's just us, baby\nThis ain't right, this is life\nThis a love hate thing\n\n\n(Keep giving me love) hold me tight, (and then you take it away) let me go\n(Keep giving me love) heal my heart, (and then you take it away) hurt my soul\n(Keep giving me love)\n\nBuild me up, (and then you take it away)\n break me down\n(Keep giving me love) Make me smile, (and then you take it away) make me frown\n(Keep giving me love)\n\nGive me love, (take it away)\n take it all away again\n(Keep giving me love) Give me love, (and then you take it away) take it all away again\n\n\n\nYeah, my affinty grows as the city gets cold\nAs you reaching your goals, you gon' meet you some foes\nHaving dinner with Leonsis I'm dreaming to own\nBut for now me and my homies see the bottom floor\nI'm trying to redefine the culture, and renovate the soul\nWomen in town, but I'm manifestating every goal\nI see potential in John, talk to him once a week\nMedia targets in our city it ain't ever sweet\nI lost a lot of friends and they ain't even dead\nWhen I was on my way up, why you ain't see the stairs?\nLord father if I opted to follow them\nMy heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here\nAnd it's rare when I'm anywhere with too many heads\nNiggas jealous and never tell it until they stare\nHow could you blame us envy?\nWe do the same thing for a living\nKnow the same niggas, but they all commend me\nChampagne I'ma spill it until we all fill up\nMaybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions\nAnd probably not, but I'm temporarily out of fizzucks\nSo tell the post to leave propaganda to politicians\n\n\n(Keep giving me love) hold me tight, (and then you take it away) let me go\n(Keep giving me love) heal my heart, (and then you take it away) hurt my soul\n(Keep giving me love)\n\nBuild me up, (and then you take it away)\n break me down\n(Keep giving me love) Make me smile, (and then you take it away) make me frown\n(Keep giving me love)\n\nGive me love, (take it away)\n take it all away again\n(Keep giving me love) Give me love, (and then you take it away) take it all away again\n"

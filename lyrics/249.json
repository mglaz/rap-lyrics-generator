        "\nMmmm, ay-oh\nHey... Ratatat, yeah!\nNa-na-na-nah\nNa-na-na-nah\n\n\nCrush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit\nFeelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 AM, summer night\nI don't care, hand on the wheel\nDriving drunk, I'm doing my thing\nRolling in the Midwest side and out\nLiving my life, getting out dreams\nPeople told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out \"Fuck that\"\nI'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back\nIf I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest\nIf I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets\n\n\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\n\n\nTell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?\nYou don't really know about nothin', nothin'\nTell me what you know about them night terrors every night\n5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky?\nTell me what you know about dreams, dreams?\nTell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing\nYou don't really care about the trials of tomorrow\nRather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow\n\n\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\n\n\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness\nI know everything that shine ain't always gold\nI'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\n\n\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\nI'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know\nEverything that shine ain't always gonna be gold\nHey, I'll be fine once I get it\nI'll be good\n\n\nPursuit of happiness, yeah\nI gon' get it, I'll be good\nOh... oh man, oh, ah, ugh\nRoom's spinnin', room's spinnin'\nPat, Zuli, where...\nOh fuck, oh my God\nWhy'd I drink so much and smoke so much? Oh, mh\nOh, fuck"

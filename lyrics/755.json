        "\nTime on my hands\nSince you've been away, boy\nI ain't got no plans, no no no no\nAnd the sound of the rain, against my windowpane\nIs slowly, is slowly drivin' me insane, boy\n\n\nI'm goin' down\nI'm goin' down\n'Cause you ain't around, baby\nMy whole world's upside down\n\n\nSleep don't come easy\nBoy, please believe me\nSince you've been gone, everything's goin' wrong\nWhy'd you have to say, \u201cGoodbye\u201d?\nLook what you've done to me\nI can't stop these tears from fallin' from my eyes, ooh baby\n\n\nI'm goin' down\nI'm goin' down\n'Cause you ain't around, baby\nMy whole world's upside down\n\n\nOoh, baby love\nGoin' down, goin' down\nMmm, I'm goin' down\nOoh I, I\n\n\nI'm goin' down\nI'm goin' down\n'Cause you ain't around, baby\nMy whole world's upside down\n\n\nOoh, goin' down, goin' down\nOh, I don't know what to do\nIf I ever lose you, I'll be goin' down\nI said, \u201cI'll be goin' down\u201d\nOh, please forgive me, baby\nI'm so sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry\nWhat did I do wrong?\nI said, \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d\nPlease forgive me, baby, and come on home\nGoin' down\nGoin' down\nGoin' down\nMmm"

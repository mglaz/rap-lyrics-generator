        "\n'Cause I'm in love with these Tumblr girls\nWith skinny waists and drug habits\nPretty faces, love status, she acts as if she's the baddest\nMan, I swear she's just like tons of girls\nShe expects the free drinks\nAnd I'm successful, she thinks\nAlways comes around when weed stinks\nWe fuck off and on, off and on\nOnly ever really fuck off and on\nNever see her these days 'cause I'm often gone\nWhen I'm home off tour, never stop for long\nBack this week from across the pond\nNoticed I was close to the block she's on\nElevator to the floor her loft is on\nDrinking whiskey, she likes vodka strong\nBut after we fuck it's over, walked out the door;\nThat's closure\nNo, I can't stay here and hold her\nTomorrow act like I don't know her\nWouldn't ever be here sober, can't tell which one is colder\nMy clothing's on, we both did wrong, I gotta go, that's what I told her, yeah\n\n\nShe said she can't feel her face\nYeah, right now I can't feel my heart\nFor your feelings, there's no place\nBut you knew that from the start\nYou and I were made of glass, we'd never last\nYou and I were made of glass, we'd never last\nMeant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed\nYou and I were made of glass, we'd never last\n\n\nShe's fine as fuck and she knows it\nSexy body, she shows it\nLoves the drama, she chose it\nShe draws the line then she blows it\nThe most fun, I suppose it\nPops a bottle, won't close it\nFeels a fit then she throws it\nShe pops a bar now she's dozing\nShe's hot and cold, hot and cold\nHomie, I don't know, she's hot and cold\nTruly the bullshit has gotten old\nSuperficial with a rotten soul\nFucking off and on, always stop and go\nProbably got someone, choose not to know\nHead to her place then we lock the door\nMaking bad calls when I'm off the blow\n'Cause she's a bitch, I'm selfish\nWant every girl, can't help it\nAnd it's tough for me to shelf it, it's you I see myself with\nRight now I know you felt it\nI touched her then she melted\nWe shouldn't chill but we do it still, gotta play the hand if you dealt it, yeah\n\n\nShe said she can't feel her face\nRight now I can't feel my heart\nFor your feelings there's no place\nBut you knew that from the start\nYou and I were made of glass, we'd never last\nYou and I were made of glass, we'd never last\nMeant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed\nYou and I were made of glass, we'd never last\n\n\nMissing everything you say\nIt's not important what you stand for\nYou're asking will he be the one\nI'll be gone before you're done tonight\nWaiting for another day\nYou're not getting what you paid for\nTrying to salvage what's undone and deny you got outrun tonight\nNever knew her name, they're looking all the same to me\nThey only chase the fame, there's no one left to blame but me"

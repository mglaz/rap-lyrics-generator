Hey, now you know\nInhale, exhale with my flow\nOne for the money, two for the bitches\nThree to get ready and four to hit the switches\nIn my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact\nWith bitches on my side and bitches on my back\nSo back up, bitch, because I'm struggling\nJust get on your knees and then start juggling\nThese motherfucking nuts in your mouth\nIt's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout\n\n\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none"

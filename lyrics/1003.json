        "\nWatch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night\nCatch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights\nNo sleep, up all week, wasting time with people I don't like\nI think something's fucking wrong with me\n\n\nDrown myself in alcohol, that shit never helps at all\nI might say some stupid things tonight when you pick up this call\nI've been hearing silence on the other side for way too long\nI can taste it on my tongue, I can tell that something's wrong, but\nI guess it's just my life and I can take it if I wanna\nBut I cannot hide in hills of California\nBecause these hills have eyes, and I got paranoia\nI hurt myself sometimes, is that too scary for you?\n\n\nWatch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night\nCatch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights\nNo sleep, up all week, wasting time with people I don't like\nI think that something's fucking wrong with me\n\n\nRoll me up and smoke me, love\nAnd we can fly into the night\nRoll me up and smoke me, love\nAnd we can fly into the night\nYou take drugs (Take drugs) to let go (Let go)\nAnd figure it all out on your own\nTake drugs (Take drugs) on gravestones (Gravestones)\nTo figure it all out on your own\n\n\nWatch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night\nCatch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights\nNo sleep, up all week, wasting time with people I don't like\nI think that something's fucking wrong with me\n\n\nFind me alone at midnight\nInside my mind, tryna get things right\n(Something's fucking wrong with me)\nThey want to keep you calling\nSo you don't wake in the morning\n(Something's fucking wrong with me)\nGoodnight, goodnight\nGoodnight, goodnight, yeah (Goodnight)\nFind me alone at midnight (Goodnight)\nInside my mind, tryna get things right (Goodnight)\nThey want to keep you calling (Goodnight)\nSo you don't wake in the morning"

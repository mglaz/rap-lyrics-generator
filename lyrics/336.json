        "\nI know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me\nNight time pissy drunk off the Henny and R\u00e9my\nI didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind it\nFelt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it\nHe was a trick when I sucked his dick\nHe used to, pass me bricks, credit cards and shit\nSuck him to sleep, I took the keys to the Jeep\nTell him, \"I'll be back,\" go fuck with some other cats\nFlirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, ho hop\nRaw top in my man's drop\nThen this homie Jimmy, he's screamin', \"Gimme\"\nLay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me\nAfter ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice\nHe was nice, kept my neck filled with ice\nPut me in Chanels, kept me out nice\nCalled suckin' his dick, \"rockin' the mic\"\nIt was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand\nSomethin' that coulda made his ass a real man\nSomethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy\nThe motherfucker never ate my pussy\n\n\nI don't want dick tonight\nEat my pussy right\nUh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now\n\n\nI know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q\nHad a wild crew on Flatbush & Avenue U\nHad a weed spot, used to pump African black\nHe used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't tap\nI used to see him, in The Tunnel, with fuckers at dawn\nWhisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on\nI dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'\nHe wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'\nThe sex was wack, a four-stroke creep\nI jumped on the dick, rode his ass to sleep\nHe called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him\n\"I thought your ass was still sleepin'\"\nHe laughed, told me he bought a new Path\nCould he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?\n\"I'll pass, nigga, the dick was trash\nIf sex was record sales you would be double glass\nThe only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me\nDowntown, taste my love like Horace Brown\nTryin' to impress me with your 5 G stones\nI give you 10 G's, nigga, if ya leave me alone,\" screamin'\n\n\nI don't want dick tonight\nEat my pussy right\nI don't want dick tonight\nEat my pussy right\n\n\nThe moral of the story is this:\nYou ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this\nAnd I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with\nThey ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this\nI ain't with that frontin' shit\nI got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends\nMe and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas\nFuck for car keys, and double-digit figures\nGood dick I cherish, I could be blunt\nI treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front\nFor limp-dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy\nSuck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?\n\n\nI don't want dick tonight\nEat my pussy right\nI don't want dick tonight\nEat my pussy right\nI don't want dick tonight"

        "\nI'm so fly, I got money\nSo that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy\nI'm so high, I'm on point\nAnd I could tell that you're jealous just by the look in your eye\nAnd when I ride by\nI don't care, G-Unit's going straight to the top this year\nNigga, I'm so fly, I got money\nSo that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy\n\n\nUh, Banks is fresh out the gutter\nToo smooth to stutter\nThe Sig will melt a brother like two scoops of butter\nBefore I leave the crib I tell my mother I love her\nGrab the burner\nBut she ain't concerned cause he's a earner\nMy bitch lays it out real nice for me to murder\nWe fight, wake up and fuck like Ike and Tina Turner\nIts a privilege to ride with a celeb'\nCause them girls over here don't got a problem giving head\nParanoia is on ya', that's why ya' llama's in ya' bed\nFuck a rare Chinchilla, buy some armor for ya' head\nWhere the block I'm from\nNiggas be damn near forty and still tucking\nAnd niggas baby mama's is pregnant and still fucking\nIt's either cause they boyfriend's a scrub like Brillo\nCause Banks is cooler than the other side of the pillow\nThe chronic is blown for my niggas that got locked up and deported\nAnd now they gotta go back home\n\n\nI'm so fly, I got money\nSo that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy\nI'm so high, I'm on point\nAnd I could tell that you're jealous just by the look in your eye\nAnd when I ride by\nI don't care, G-Unit's going straight to the top this year\nNigga, I'm so fly, I got money\nSo that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy\n\n\nDon't confuse me with these suckers\nCause when I spit, You'll hear more \"oh's\"\nThan a skip to my Lou move at the Rucker\nThank God for giving Banks the gift\nYou think that bandana makes you look gangsta\nBut all I see is a handkerchief\nNigga, there's no one out the click that freezes\nBelieve that, cause I ain't scared of shit but Jesus\nLook dog, I don't run with the poodles\nDifference is, I'm eating in Rome and you eating Roman Noodles\nYa' boy is corrupt kid\nBanks'll send a bitch to the store\nJust for a piece of cheesecake like Puff did\nYou chumps can't afford these homes\nLook around, I got forty clones\nNow Look down, that's forty stones\nAnd that's only in the necklace\nI'm bony and I'm reckless\nIt's Tony in a Lexus\nI'm fresh out the gutter, scrap what ya' man thought\nI'm in the hood with more straps than a Jan sport\n\n\nI'm so fly, I got money\nSo that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy\nI'm so high, I'm on point\nAnd I could tell that you're jealous just by the look in your eye\nAnd when I ride by\nI don't care, G-Unit's going straight to the top this year\nNigga, I'm so fly, I got money\nSo that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy\n\n\nWhen I travel I know I'm gon' get stuck\nCause they harass us in the airport\nLike I'm the one that's blowing shit up\nI got the patience of a high school teacher\nAnd a bright future\nWhy the fuck would I have a bomb on my sneaker?\nAll the goodie girls back off us\nMy hearts colder then Jack Frost is\nWe pack shows and attract bosses\nBlack clothes with my black Forces\nA black rose for a rat's coffin\nI'm blowing O's of that black coughing\nBlow on the road then I'm back flossing\nNo one knows how much that's costing\nFuck ass, only the green moves me\nI got a clean Uzi\nA pair of gloves and a mask from the Scream movie\nSo if you plotting on popping off, then scheme smoothly\nOr get a little red splatter on ya' cream Coogi\nMy name ring each state\nSo you ain't gotta go all the way to L.A. to get ya MC ate\n\n\nI'm so fly, I got money\nSo that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy\nI'm so high, I'm on point\nAnd I could tell that you're jealous just by the look in your eye\nAnd when I ride by\nI don't care, G-Unit's going straight to the top this year\nNigga, I'm so fly, I got money\nSo that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy"

        "\nHow beautiful love can be\nOn the streets love is hard to see\nIt's a place I got to be\nLoving you is loving me\nHow beautiful love can be\nOn the streets love is hard to see\nGotta reach that frequency\nLoving you is loving me\n\n\nYeah, you know what love is\nEven found it on the ground where the thugs live\nMy man had to dig deep to find his\nCouldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids\nLive nig's, real niggas express and taste it\nAt crap games, black dames and big faces\nCases in court, fam' showing love and support\nYou and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport\nAs men we were taught to hold it in\nThat's why we don't know how 'til we're older men\nIf love is a place I'ma go again\nAt least now, now I know to go within\nAt times it can take ya for a spin\nHeartbreak hotel then you're home again\nI've seen love make a nigga soul pretend\nLike a story that he don't want to end, yo\n\n\nHow beautiful love can be\nOn the streets love is hard to see\nIt's a place I got to be\nLoving you is loving me\nHow beautiful love can be\nOn the streets love is hard to see\nGotta reach that frequency\nLoving you is loving me\n\n\nIt's all love where we come from\nIn the hood love we was told to run from\nThat same hood where the guns sung\nWe holla love, hoping it'd become one\nCrack got so many lives undone\nFrom lack of love many hide, some run\nI knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays\nDemonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze\nTrying to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave\nLove can free us, to it some of us react as a slave\nFunny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave\nWonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?\nEverybody loves sun, why do I attract shade?\nHeard of the love of money, but compassion it pays\nTalk about it with my youth so she'd understand\nWhat it is to be loved by a man\n\n\nHow beautiful love can be\nOn the streets love is hard to see\nIt's a place I got to be\nLoving you is loving me\nHow beautiful love can be\nOn the streets love is hard to see\nGotta reach that frequency\nLoving you is loving me\n\n\nSome say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often\nSeen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin\nWe walk and stand in, fall in it\nWith the right companion we all in it\nMary sang a song about it, having broad limits\nIn the game of life, it's the scrimmage\nReminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days\nA letter to the people, love always, yeah\n\n\nHow beautiful love can be\nOn the streets love is hard to see\nIt's a place I got to be\nLoving you is loving me\nHow beautiful love can be\nOn the streets love is hard to see\nGotta reach that frequency\nLoving you is loving me"

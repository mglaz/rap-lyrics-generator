        "\nI don't got a single sober vein in my body\nI don't got a single sober vein in my body\n\n\nDon't apologize, I quite enjoy messy\nI see that bottle after bottle got you goin' crazy\nAnd doin' shows after shows got me so lazy\nSo ride it out for me, and take it off for me\nIt's a good vibe, good vibe, good vibe\nDon't you ever threaten niggas with a good time\nShe wanna buy a dream, I said I don't sell it\nBut she can rent it for a night, I don't mind, open wide\nCause all this fame, I earned it, I might as well use it\nPrivate elevator goin' straight to my unit\nAll my niggas 'round me, gettin' kickback pussy\nAll my killas 'round me, all be hiding in Stussy\nCan't nobody stop me, used to be homeless\nNow that penthouse at the Ritz where my home is\nTour bus like a National Geographic\nBitches runnin' wild gettin' faded in the bathroom\n\n\nIt makes me smile, it makes me smile\nCause I got it\nIt makes me smile, it makes me smile\nCause I got it\nAll the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece\nBut now we got it\nMan look at the kid now, can nobody stop me?\nI don't got a single sober vein in my body\n\n\nFuck her like a thug nigga, young nigga, new Ferrari\nOld money, I just 'fraid the Lord with us\nCondo blow money, like it's all dope money\nCome short wet niggas, like a speed boat coming, oh Lord\nMo money, mo money, these rich young niggas ain't ever know money\nBelaire running down the Rollie on her arm\nPinky ring six-hundred, what you know about it\nI'm the champ, baby, Real Deal Holyfield\nGot the bitches, want it dirty, went and bought the crib\n25 mil, I'm doing 25-to-life\n100 acres, keep my shooters all through the night\nEvery chandelier ran a nigga, one-mil\n20 chandeliers motherfucker who real\nI just wanna show her what I live like\nWearing a white Birkin on a winter night\nFuck a Birkin, now she in the Bentley\nThat's when she went and tatted double M G\nNow our bond deep, deeper than the rap\nShe give me brain she a mastermind to be exact\nShe a mastermind to be exact\nI give her game and she give it back\nSip syrup so I fuck slow, sip more I wanna fuck more\nGotta grind 'till your eyes close,\nStay strapped 'till the trap close\nThey scream Maybach on the cell blocks\nAll my dawgs who used to sell blocks\nThey say the niggas in the jail talk\nHow your homies commissary fell off\nWhat make it worse he get an elbows\n25-to-life dead wrong on the cell phone\n\n\nIt makes me smile, it makes me smile\nCause I got it\nIt makes me smile, it makes me smile\nCause I got it\nAll the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece\nBut now we got it\nMan look at the kid now, can nobody stop me?\nI don't got a single sober vein in my body"

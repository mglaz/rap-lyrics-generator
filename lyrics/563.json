        "\nIf you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend\nSo fill up your cup and lift your lighter, a toast to life\n\n\nLuda\nThey say what don't kill me can make me stronger\nSo two drinks a night should help me live longer\nI blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test\n'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death?\nI'm on a journey, yeah I'm on a roll\nSometimes gotta close my eyes just to open my soul\nAnd tonight is the night I got a feeling that I'm about to act a fool\nSo if you go fix some drinks me and Usher about to break some rules\n\n\nThat's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow\nI was born for the fast life\nI go for broke, a lesson I can't afford\nBut for what it's worth I'm ready to pay\nFor the rest of my life\nFor the rest of my life\nOh, oh, oh\n\n\nNa na, hey, oh\nNa na, hey, oh\nNa na, hey, oh\nNa na, hey\nFor the rest of my life\n\n\nIf I got one life to live, I'ma party 'til I'm dead\nWhat the hell is a life worth livin' if it's not on the edge?\nTryna keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall\nWritten on my tombstone should say \"Women, Weed, and Alcohol\"\n\n\nThat's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow\nI was born for the fast life\nI go for broke, a lesson I can't afford\nBut for what it's worth I'm ready to pay\nFor the rest of my life\nFor the rest of my life\nOh, oh, oh\n\n\nNa na, hey, oh\nNa na, hey, oh\nNa na, hey, oh\nNa na, hey\n\n\nIf you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend\nSo fill up your cup, lift your lighters, a toast to life\n\n\nI'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time\nCause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind\nAnd you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice\nSo I'm willin' to bet that I'ma be crazy for the rest of...\n\n\nFor the rest of my life\nFor the rest of my life\nFor the rest of my life"

        "\n\n\nFuck the frail shit, uh, 'cause when my coke come in\nThey gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with\nCarlssons on the jeep, Bugatti made the prototype\nHoped you'd get the picture but you just can't photo life\nDetermined niggas make it\nKicking down the door and we burning niggas naked\nThe house costs a million, sitting on the beach\nAnd the only thing I know: if it's furnished I'ma take it\nMy bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360\nWe got the shit that the government got\nTalking money then you rubbing the spot\nReal niggas say that they be wilding\nWe on the Cayman Islands on a yacht with our favorite albums\nA bad ho and a plate of salmon, smoking and drinking\nNigga is you thinking that our fate is violent?\nI love my nigga for the fact that he real\nAnd nobody on the faculty squeal\nAnd if you facing capital pun, pass me a gun\nAnd I'ma give you time to run while I rapidly peel, uh\n\n\nWe gon' make it\nWe gon' make it, we gon' make it\nWe gon' make it\nWe gon' make it, we gon' make it\nWe gon' make it\n\n\nI learned the game quickly, and I don't like to rent\nSo when I fly now, I bring my cars on the plane with me\nIn this case who's the loser?\nRan through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba\nTeaching kids how to read and write and use the Ruger\nMotherfuckin' niggas is back, Jada and P\nWe got water, X, haze, plus weight of the D\nAnd I'm tired of hearing about old niggas that had it\nAnd be the same old niggas that ratted (Who cares?)\nTalking 'bout how we hawk niggas in they fuckin' back\nGun work's official but niggas don't be wanting that\n(Why?) 'Cause they puss and they mans is lame\nWe Soul for Real in the hood, we make Candy Rain\nI could easily send you to God\nBut come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job\nIf you can't remember the name\nAll you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver it hard\n\n\nWe gon' make it\nWe gon' make it, we gon' make it\nWe gon' make it\nWe gon' make it, we gon' make it\n\n\nJada-MWAH, I'll kiss you, you bitch ass nigga\nBet the hood won't miss you, you bitch ass nigga\nMight find your man dead in the ocean (he be aight though)\nYou know dead rappers get better promotion\nWhy we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth\nNever say you can't do it 'til you try it first\nBe the young niggas eager to pull it\nBut it's a message in everything, trust me, even a bullet\nGo to war with the 8 and the pound\nThink you got your ear to the street now\nPut your face in the ground 'cause my shells is expensive\nYou'll know exactly why when you yellin' in intensive\nMy fellas is offensive\nLucky 'cause I got guns that crack your back\nBut that's not what I prefer, I manufacture crack\nAnd niggas turn bitch when you show em the steel\nBut we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal\nI'm comfortable far from home\nEating right, getting good rest either on the bar or the phone\nI'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years\n\"Sound anything like Kiss? Then sign right here!\"\nAnd, y'all just talking, I'm doing it well\nJadakiss, motherfucker, I'ma see you in hell\n\n\nWe gon' make it\nWe gon' make it, we gon' make it\nWe gon' make it\nWe gon' make it, we gon' make it\nWe gon' make it"

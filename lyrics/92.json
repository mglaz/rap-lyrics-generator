        "\nMan, what? (Haha)\nThis shit funny, one sec\nOof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy\n\n\nShe told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)\nAnd nobody gets hurt (No hurt)\nNow I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)\nSo I'm making it worse (Making it worse)\nNow I'm digging up a grave, from my past\nI'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)\nIt's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)\nBut I cannot reverse it\n\n\nI can't reverse it\nIt was a gift and a curse\nAnd now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur\nLast time I saw you, it ended in a blur\nI woke up in a hearse\nYou said, \"You loved me first\" (First)\nOne thing my dad told me was, \"Never let your woman know when you're insecure\"\nSo I put Gucci on the fur\nAnd I put my wrist on iceberg\nOne thing my heart tells me is\n\"Flex on a ho every time they're insecure\"\nI guess you came through, I'm running from you\nIs your love for real? (For real? For real?)\nIs your love really true?\n\n\nShe told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)\nAnd nobody gets hurt (Hurt)\nNow I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)\nSo I'm making it worse (Worse)\nNow I'm digging up a grave, from my past (Past)\nI'm a whole different person (Person)\nIt's a gift and a curse (Curse)\nBut I cannot reverse it\n\n\nYou gave me the runaround\nI really hate the runaround\nYou really got me paranoid\nI always keep a gun around\nYou always give me butterflies\nWhen you come around\nWhen you come around\nWhen you come around\n\n\nYou let me know love is not the answer\nNot the answer, not the answer\nI love to do drugs so mind my manners\nI get high when you don't decide to answer\nPhone home, I need to phone home\nI'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home\nI don't wanna leave\nI just wanna be with you\nYou, you, you\n\n\nShe told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)\nAnd nobody gets hurt (No hurt)\nNow I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)\nSo I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)\nNow I'm digging up a grave, from my past\nI'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)\nIt's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)\nBut I cannot reverse it"

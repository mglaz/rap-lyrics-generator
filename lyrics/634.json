        "\nMacaroni time\nShe say she like my car, Forgis ride\nSeen me with tha stars, now she wanna know me now\nUnh-unh 'cause I told her now I'm actin' phony now\nBuck buck for nigga think it's macaroni time\n\n\nShe say she like my car and she like how my Forgis ride\nShe seen me with them stars now she wanna know me now\nUnh-unh 'cause I'm Tony now I'm actin' phony now\nBuck buck for a nigga think it's macaroni time\nCouple bucks for these bitches, let me slap them on they ass\nTough luck for these niggas think they next I'm on they ass\nSo what I walk in court smelling like packs? I got them bands\nGlo' boys that's what almighty Sosa got them sayin'\n\n\nShe wanna be a Glory Girl, but she don't like my Glory Guys\nI know this bitch a thot, she wanna meet my momma now\nBut unh-unh I gotta QP of earth rolling, let's get high\nLight it up, I guarantee that she will touch the sky\nHe say he gettin' money but I know that's a lie\nI see ones and fives in your bankroll right now\nBut unh-unh you ain't flexin' boy you need some exercise\nYou cuttin' up you need some GBE lessons now\nI hear these niggas flexin' sayin' they know the Glory Gang\nHow you know us if we don't know your name?\nUnh-unh just bought a pint I'm leanin right now\nDumb fuck just popped a flat, I'm beamin' right now\nUnh-unh I feel like catchin' a homie right now\nNo love, I see a opp I'm droppin' him right now\nShe let me fuck then I'm droppin her' right now\nI'ma hop up in my 'Rari top, I'm dropping it right now\n\n\nShe say she like my car and she like how my Forgis ride\nShe seen me with them stars now she wanna know me now\nUnh-unh 'cause I'm Tony now I'm actin' phony now\nBuck buck for a nigga think it's macaroni time\nCouple bucks for these bitches, let me slap them on they ass\nTough luck for these niggas think they next I'm on they ass\nSo what I walk in court smelling like packs? I got them bands\nGlo' boys that's what almighty Sosa got them sayin'"

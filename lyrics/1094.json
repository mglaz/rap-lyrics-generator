I was 15 and you play me like R.Kelly\nReady for suicide I'm getting my tubes tied\nDon't want another man on me cause I imagine you inside\nRefuse to be abused, misused and bruised\nYou get accused and act confused fuck wrong with this dude?\nBitch ass prick you ain't slick, why me?\nWhy I have to be the victim you pick?\nI was just a sophomore (yeah bitch)\nYou belong in one room, no windows, one door\nI'm cool and I got God to cherish me\nThat's the only man  that I need until I get me some therapy\n\n\n(He said) Promise me you won't tell\n(He said) Promise me you won't tell\n(He said) Just promise me you won't tell\nIf I take you to the hotel\n(He said) Promise me you won't tell\n(He said) Promise me you won't tell\n(He said) Just promise me you won't tell\nIf I take you to the hotel"

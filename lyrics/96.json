        "\nFrom the unknown\nI ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home\nWhoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa\nLike a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam\nAin't no right way, just the wrong way I know\nI problem-solve with Styrofoam\nMy world revolves around a black hole\nThe same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh\nEmpty, I feel so goddamn empty\nI may go rogue\nDon't tempt me, big bullet holes\nTote semi-autos\n\n\nHuh, yeah\nI'm keepin' it real, real\nI'm keepin' it real, uh, yeah\nLife gets tough, shit is getting real (Yeah)\nI don't know how to feel\nSwallowing all these pills\nNumb my real feels, uh\nDevil standing here\nTryna' make a deal, uh\nIt ain't no deals\nFeel like I'm going crazy but still took a lot to get me here\nLosing my sanity up in a house in the hills, hills, hills\nI ain't have anything then and I still don't have anything still, still, still, uh\nBein' me, I rock, PnB\nThese hoes actin' like gossip, TMZ\nThese drugs acting like\nMosh pits squishing me\nOh my, oh me, how they kill me slowly\nLonely, I been gettin' no peace\nOD, feel like overdosing\nLow key I been looking for the signs\nBut all I can find is a sign of the times\n\n\nFrom the unknown\nI ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home\nWhoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa\nLike a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam\nAin't no right way, just the wrong way I know\nI problem-solve with Styrofoam\nMy world revolves around a black hole\nThe same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh\nEmpty, I feel so goddamn empty\nI may go rogue\nDon't tempt me, big bullet holes\nTote semi-autos\n\n\nI ain't suicidal\nOnly thing suicide is suicide doors\nFight for survival\nGotta keep hope up, rolling good dope up (Uh)\nHold my hand, through hell we go\nDon't look back, it ain't the past no more\nGonna get to the racks, all them niggas want war\nYeah, I was put here to lead the lost souls\nExhale depression as the wind blows\nThese are the laws of livin' in vogue\nWe're perfectly imperfect children\nRose from the dust, all of us are on a mission\nNever gave a fuck, really came from rags to riches\nNow we live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'\nI don't give a fuck, really came from rags to riches\nNow I live it up, driving with the rooftop missin'\n\n\nFrom the unknown\nI ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home\nWhoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa\nLike a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam\nAin't no right way, just the wrong way I know\nI problem-solve with Styrofoam\nMy world revolves around a black hole\nThe same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh\nEmpty, I feel so goddamn empty\nI may go rogue\nDon't tempt me, big bullet holes\nTote semi-autos"

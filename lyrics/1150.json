        "\nLet's get it\nLet's get it\n\n (x2)\nBroke boy seen me flexing he said \"What's up\"\nI told that boy he need to get his guap up\nI got big bands I got Glocks tucked\nRun up on me goofy they go buck buck\n\n\nI got 30's, 40's, ya, they on me\nEven when I ride alone, I'm never lonely\nEverywhere I go, keep a pole on me\nAnd they gon' buck buck if you run up on me\nEverything I'm rocking is designed up\nDesigner belt on my waist keep my nine tucked\nSay you gon' rob me, you get lined up\nSmoking blunts with the lean, bitch, I'm high as fuck\nI got big bands, I love cashin' out\nSo run up on me and that's a man down\nI got Glocks tucked and they popping out\nBoom, boom boom, boom ambulance sounds\n\n (x2)\nBroke boy seen me flexing he said \"What's up\"\nI told that boy he need to get his guap up\nI got big bands I got Glocks tucked\nRun up on me goofy they go buck buck\n\n\nHe said he gon' rob me, tell 'em pull up\nFlexing say he stained me, he ain't in no cuts\nAin't afraid of nun, I got my hand tucked\nAnd if you run up then it go buck buck\nI done dropped a couple bands on some fucking belts\nAnd I made that money all by myself\nJust me and my pole, don't need no help\nWhen your diamonds shine like mine you got to protect yourself\nBitch I'm flexing now cause I'm balling out\nYour bitch will give me top cause I got all the clout\nOff the loud, I ain't hearing what they talking about\nTalking all that rap shit, my shooters popping out\n\n (x2)\nBroke boy seen me flexing he said \"What's up\"\nI told that boy he need to get his guap up\nI got big bands I got Glocks tucked\nRun up on me goofy they go buck buck"

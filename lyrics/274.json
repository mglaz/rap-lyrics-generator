        "\nYou be anything you want\nJust keep going, going, gone, gone, gone\nIt don't stop here nigga\n\n\nBack when I was young I had dreams of getting richer\nThen my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture\nI was with some wild niggas put me on the game\nTold me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie\nAll you got your name and your word so never break it\nFor this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it\nCause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from\nAin't no conversation all they understand is get a gun\nI was riding in my Bonneville hoping I could make it\nOut selling P\u2019s and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street\nWay back in the day before I had all of this paper\nBefore I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters\n\n\nNow I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'\nI remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing\nAlways in a different state so now they label me a goner\nI ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner\nNow everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there\nNow everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there\nAnd I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it\nSayin' fuck the ones who hated, roll one up and celebrate\n\n\nNow let's get medicated\nMan, let's get medicated\nLet's get medicated\nMan I'm hella faded\nMan, let's get medicated\nLet's get medicated\nLet's get medicated\nMan I'm hella faded\nI'm hella faded\n\n\nRoll that weed up and smoke it\nTake your bitch home and poke it\nJuicy be gettin' so faded\nThank God I got a chauffeur\nOnly good cali bud\nPulling hoes bad as fuck\nJust like a youngin' my nigga\nJuicy do all them drugs\nNiggas smoking that babbage weed\nI be on that light green\nPop molly in the after hours\nA member of no sleep team\nGet a whole pound smoke it by myself\nOr maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps\n\n\nYou known I\u2019m fresh up off that corner, twistin marijuana\nThey copy us, they clone us\nYeah we so fly we owners\nGot acting like they been before\nBut they ain't never been at all\n8 balls I was in the hall\nAin't have time to fuck with y'all\nChampagne when we celebrate\nKeen sense so I smell the hate\nMiddle finger we getting paid\nIt cost much but don't press that eight\nThat dotted line it ain't like that day\nComic book let me illustrate\nLike power bang when they lift that cane\nMy cousin died wish I can get that day\nBack like it's a vertebrae\nBring that nigga on front street\nTalk about and never be about it\nThey don't wanna beef cause that's lunch meat\nSo anything you need you know that's on me\nAnd that's OG, I swear homie\n\n\nNow let's get medicated\nMan, let's get medicated\nLet's get medicated\nMan I'm hella faded\nMan, let's get medicated\nLet's get medicated\nLet's get medicated\nMan I'm hella faded\nI'm hella faded\n\n\nRiding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique\nMy city holding on to me so niggas holding on their heat\nThrowing up their side, rolling up that leaf\nAll we do is get high, all we want is peace\nAlways on the grind that's every day so police looking\nI'm just rapping killing beats and tryin' to stay away from booking\nYeah my niggas dirty crooked I just had to make it on\nAnd let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home\n\n\nNow I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'\nI remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing\nAlways in a different state so now they label me a goner\nI ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner\nNow everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there\nNow everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there\nAnd I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it\nSayin' fuck the ones who hated, roll one up and celebrate\n\n\nNow let's get medicated\nMan, let's get medicated\nLet's get medicated\nMan I'm hella faded\nMan, let's get medicated\nLet's get medicated\nLet's get medicated\nMan I'm hella faded\nI'm hella faded"

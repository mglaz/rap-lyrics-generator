        "Uh Girls Y'all gotta feel me on this one\nY'all know how it be you Just been with your man\nFor so long and you think you got him figured out\nAnd things aight thats how I was\nI thought I had him all figured out\nBut he just kept surpising me everytime I looked around\nIt was just (trouble) some more trouble (trouble times)\nDamn\n\n\nIt's hard on the yard I'm all alone in this struggle\nI can't trust these hoes your bestfriends be your foes\nNo one to talk to better watch what you say\nFast as you tell them shit them hoes be on the freeway\nFace it, you got a dream? your ass better chase it\nNigga giving you problems have that nigga replacements\nExcuses to fight you everytime your lights do\nAnd as soon as you in another nigga chest they stress\nFuck them I ain't the nice type or the wife type\nI ain't nann one of them boojie chicks I'm a rude bitch\nFuck your family and your phoney ass mammy\nAll up in my shit trying to watch what you hand me\nI had this shit way before I even met your ass\nI keep house and a car and some cash\nFor when I'm ready to leave your ass I can't trust you\nThat's why I keep some shit you can't take\nAnd that's a hustle\n\n\nAll this time you been with me\nI was just living in misery\nI prayed and prayed for a change\nBut only rain came my way\nAll this time you been with me\nI was just sleeping with the enemy\nAll this time you been with me\nI was just sleeping with the enemy\n\n\nI mean you hurted me so bad I wanted to do you\nI mean you hurted a bitch so bad I wanted to use vodoo\nTo bury your name but that ain't my game\nI was willing to do anythang to ease that pain\nWe been through to much made to many bucks\nTouch to many blocks had to many niggas shot\nFor the shit to just drop\nIt's the latest talk in the nail shop\nEverybody knows I can just hear the hoes\nChicks I use to ride with can't even confide with\nThat shit bothers me I wanna bleed them hoes artries\nI don't feel safe no more\nYou don't leave the keys to the safe no more\nYou ain't trust your boosters the time I busted you\nYou won't let me load your clip or hide your bricks\nYou don't trust me with the accounts and books and shit\nBut you trust me your life cause everynight I cook\nFuck Nigga\n\n\n\n\nAct three let me see if I can sum it up\nEvery credit card you had I tried to run it up\nAnd everytime we fucked nigga I hated it\nAnd everytime I said I bust a nut well I faked it\nEvery key you left unguarded yeah I scared it\nAnd you don't know cut even blow know blow from blow up\nWhen your spot fell off I stayed up in the malls\nWith fraud making sure we eat\nAnd making sure shit sweet started flipping your riches\nGot to big for your britches\nStayed up in them titty bars with them sick bitches\nAnd your homeboys crackers got them singing like birds\nTold them boys where you serve\nAnd where you stashed your word\nSame niggas you be rolling with that be skinning\nAnd grinning when you ain't home\nThey be begging to get up in my denim\nIt ain't my fault I got legs with bows in them\nA petite shit with a sweet clit\nAnd C cups to make you nut\nCause you ain't never had a bitch like me\nLike O that can spit like me\nThat can ass in a six like me\nHold it down through your B.I.D\nHonestly you had the best of me but you a enemy\n\n\n\n\nI just gotta be strong on this one\n(you are the enemy)\nI don't think I'm going back this time\n(you are the enemy, you are the enemy)\nJust to much shit been said to much real shit been said\n(you are the enemy, you are the enemy)\nIt's true I ain't gotta deal with this\n\n"

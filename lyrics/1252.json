        "\nA whole new ten that I can lay down with\nSent the pic to me, told her that she look astoundin'\nWalked in and she caught the down wind\nAnd she like the way I'm well-rounded\nDon't talk too much, if I'm honest with you, might be off too much\nBrrp, brrp, prrp, prrp, shawty, pick your phone up\nPick your phone up, pick your phone up, yeah\nLet's go, wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, shawty pick your phone up\nPick that phone up for your boy\nShe want the boy 'cause I'm feeling outstandin'\nBuy her a bag 'cause I'm feeling romantic\nSkkrt-Skkrt, watch that Rari do damage\nI made her turn up her standards, let's go\n\n\nYou know that I'm tryna' dive in you\nHis and her coupes, watch me glide with you\nRoll up that wood and get high with you\nStay 1-K, ain't no surprise with you\nHit my line when you want that lumber\nShawty you been high and I'ma catch you in the summer\nTurn a fifty-play into a a-hundred, ain't no fumbles\nYour ex said he ballin', but he got no jumper\nShout my boy Harlow, racks in my cargo\nMills on my mind, I'ma get that tomorrow\nBack in the day, used to whip Monte Carlos\nShout my boy Bobby, shout my boy Harvo\n\n\nA whole new ten that I can lay down with\nSent the pic to me, told her that she look astoundin'\nWalked in and she caught the down wind\nAnd she like the way I'm well-rounded\nDon't talk too much, if I'm honest with you, might be off too much\nI banged one too much, I was off the liquor when I called you up\nBrrp, brrp, prrp, prrp, shawty, pick your phone up\nPick your phone up, pick your phone up, yeah\nLet's go, wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, shawty, pick your phone up\nPick that phone up for your boy\nShe want the boy 'cause I'm feeling outstandin'\nBuy her a bag 'cause I'm feeling romantic\n\n\nI feel like Drizzy on \"Ransom\", me and her fuck like we stranded\nDon't know what the strand is\nIt was handed to me and I don't know whose hand it is\nOnly take it if it's candid\nI don't wanna' pose for you, I won't be commanded\nMoving like a bandit\nI am not enrolled, but a youngin' on campus\nShe gon' let me hit it and I'm headed to Atlantis\nAt the pool party lookin' like I'm Pete Sampras\nI don't miss no gimmes, I ain't mean to come off so friendly\nIn the morning maybe we can do Denny's\nI wanted Cracker Barrel, but you know it gets busy\n\n\nA whole new ten that I can lay down with\nSent the pic to me, told her that she look astoundin'\nWalked in and she caught the down wind\nAnd she like the way I'm well-rounded\nDon't talk too much, if I'm honest with you, might be off too much\nI banged one too much, I was off the liquor when I called you up\nBrrp, brrp, prrp, prrp, shawty, pick your phone up\nPick your phone up, pick your phone up, yeah\nLet's go, wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, shawty, pick your phone up\nPick that phone up for your boy\nShe want the boy 'cause I'm feeling outstandin'\nBuy her a bag 'cause I'm feeling romantic\nSkkrt-Skkrt, watch that Rari do damage\nI made her turn up her standards, let's go"

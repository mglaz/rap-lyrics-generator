        "\nThis shit crazy\nLook\n\n\nBean bag full of shots different from a bag of Skittles\nIf shit get bumpy bust it in yo face like a fucking pimple\nI need God to answer more prayers so I'm headed to the temple\nBitches sit around on they ass like they done failed cripple\nEvery convo got a time limit\nCause I dont like to put my mind in it\nI don't sympathize with nobody guys\nLook me in my eyes and they traumatized\nA nigga can't even make me blush\nCause I get more play than Toys R Us\nLay her body out like thin crust so we can chop it up with no Pizza Hut\nWaste time on a amateur, give him 31 shots no calendar\nI bet he kick back when he heat it make a nigga jump like a cheerleader\nFeel it like Peter pushing bitches to the side like Amina\nSince I'm the color of a pork and bean\nI don't wanna see no cops on the scene\nCause shit could get terrible\nSo when I move a body or I do a robbery I'm careful\nStained quick you ain't getting shit, money ain't shareable\nSo don't try to walk a day in my shoes, he-hell naw they ain't wearable\n\n\nMight need me a church niggas finna get hurt\nDig deep in that dirt for that body you search\nFor that money I search  for that body they search\nFor that money I search for that body they search\nMight need me a church niggas finna get hurt\nDig deep in that dirt for that body you search\nFor that money I search  for that body they search\nFor that money I search for that body they search\n\n\nI'm a search search search search\nI'm a search search search search\nI'm a search search search search\nFor that money I search for that body they search\n\n\nShorty I can't even save ya, like I ran out of data\nBitch I'm typing up yo will, gone say bye to Jada\nGot guns in the backseat bigger than an alligator\nIf I draw the chopper on you it's only out to erase you\nLet me show you a sample, aim at yo head\nMake it bubble like shampoo\nMoney ain't coming slow-mo, if it cost to be the boss\nThen nigga what's the total?\nNiggas say they global, they not even mobile\nWe can't even social ,got him getting vocal\nI'm just on a move half the ones who ain't got shit\nGot hella shit to prove (bitches)\nBitches still broke if you getting money and them bills due\nHolla at my mans fo' he talk them bands cause I'm not a fool\nBig family I got to feed more than the Huxtables\nSo when you see me in yo sight\nBets believe I'm finna hustle you\nMotherfuckers out here owe me money thinking they untouchable\nIf she don't meet me with my cheese\nI'm a crack her that's a Lunchable\n\n\nMight need me a church niggas finna get hurt\nDig deep in that dirt for that body you search\nFor that money I search  for that body they search\nFor that money I search for that body they search\nMight need me a church niggas finna get hurt\nDig deep in that dirt for that body you search\nFor that money I search  for that body they search\nFor that money I search for that body they search\n\n\nI'm a search search search search\nI'm a search search search search\nI'm a search search search search\nFor that money I search for that body they search"

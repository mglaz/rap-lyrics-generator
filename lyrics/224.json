        "\nYeah, you know sometimes I think\nThey don't truly understand me, you know\nCause they don't, yeah, uh\n\n\nCan't change the world unless we change ourselves\nDie from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health\nAll eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt\nFull house on my hands, the cards I was dealt\nThree K's, two A's in AmeriKKKa\nI'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula\nAnd everything I do or say today that's worthwhile\nWill for sure inspire actions in your first child\nI'll begin my verse now\n\n\nSometimes I speak and I feel like it ain't my words\nLike I'm just a vessel channeling inside this universe\nI feel my ancestors unrested inside of me\nIt's like they want me to shoot my chance in changing society\nBut how do I go about it? Tell me where I start?\nMy destiny rerouted when I chose to follow heart\nYou told to follow suit, but tell me what it do for you?\nExcept weigh you down, now you trapped inside the cubicle\nThey built for us\nThe first step into change is to take notice\nRealize the real games that they tried to show us\n300 plus years of them cold shoulders\nYet 300 million of us still got no focus\nSorry America, but I will not be your soldier\nObama just wasn't enough, I need some more closure\nAnd Donald Trump is not equipped to take this country over\nLet\u2019s face facts 'cause we know what\u2019s the real motives\n\n\nIn the land of the free, it's full of free loaders\nLeave us dead in the street to be their organ donors\nThey disorganized my people, made us all loners\nStill got the last names of our slave owners\nIn the land of the free, it's full of free loaders\nLeave us dead in the street to be their organ donors\nThey disorganized my people, made us all loners, yeah\n\n\nWe can't change the world unless we change ourselves\nDie from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health\nAll eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt\nFull house on my hands, the cards I was dealt\nThree K's, two A's in AmeriKKKa\nI'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula\nAnd everything I do or say today is worthwhile\nWill for sure inspire action, hold up, yeah, uh\n\n\nTrickery in the system, put my niggas in prison\nAll our history hidden, ain't no liberty given\nWe all fit the description of what the documents written\nWe been lacking the vision and barely making a living\nWe too worried to fit in while they been benefitin'\nEvery time you submittin', we all guilty admit it\nThe Lord won't get you acquitted, but you still ask for forgiveness\nPut opiates in syringes then inject his religion\nHow many times do I gotta tell you I'm a man on a mission\nMany times I gotta tell you I don't need no permission\nA human with super vision, ain't no livin' condition\nI'm reaching out to my children, just hoping that they will listen\nStart a new coalition against corrupt politicians\nIt's not enough pots to piss in, too many murder convictions\nAnother family evicted, another black man a victim\nThat's as real as it's getting, you should take recognition\n\n\nIn the land of the free, it's full of free loaders\nLeave us dead in the street to be their organ donors\nThey disorganized my people, made us all loners\nStill got the last name of our slave owners\nIn the land of the free, it's full of free loaders\nLeave us dead in the street to be their organ donors\nThey disorganized my people, made us all loners, yeah\n\n\nWe can't change the world unless we change ourselves\nDie from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health\nAll eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt\nFull house on my hands, the cards I was dealt\nThree K's, two A's in AmeriKKKa\nI'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula\nAnd everything I do or say today is worthwhile\nWill for sure inspire action in your first child, yeah"

        "\nPretty sure I'm maniacal, but what do I know?\nI don't know, all I know is what I see through my monocle\nThat and the telescope, keep one lens on the money flow\nThe other's gold and complemental trusty, well, well\nI'm rolling down hills in a suit through the mud\nThrow my dress shoes in a fire with the woods\nSit back and relax with the fumes of everything I hate in the world\nPlay Mozart, smoke my cigar on\nMy estate, keep the cars parked on the front lawn\nNeighbors hate, place duct tape underneath their tires\nAnd I wait\n\n\nSun sets to blood moon horizons\nLeft brain and right brain divided\nSet frames and watch plays inside them\nIn the mountains now's where you'll find him\nI smell a breeze in the morning\nI feel your presence, it's warming\nI paid attention to warnings\nBut we were too caught up in transforming\n\n\nGhetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty\nFloating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to\nGhetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty\nFloating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to\nGhetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty\nFloating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to\nGhetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty\nFloating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to\n\n\nLucky days, I'm burnin' the four sil\nYour boy is dusty like brush up a fossil\nHear that shit urk like the noise of a possum\nBitch, I'm a king, I was born in the castle\nBuilt like a boxer, I'm ready to tussle\nFuck on my baby, I'm ready to bust one\nCome fuck with me and my dogs\nHate on my ass like in-laws, uh\nThat boy stay light like a cheerleader, um\nShe want me filled like a two-liter, um\nEat it all day, watch it ricochet off\nThen I skrrt off on that Michelin, aw\nThey don't got nothing on me 'til I pop\nThey don't got nothing on me, call the cops\nI hit that run like a Heisman boy, run it back\nLook at that boy, hit that running back\n\n\nShout out to South Central, San Marcos\nI got addicted to soft shell tacos\nRight after pennies and ramen noodles\nNow, I see how I'm gon' make a shooter\nStamina, stamina!\nI used to be holding the camera\nHead through the glass, throw your window up\nStart praying to me like my handle Cortana\nWe like Wu-Tang, but I feel like Santana\nSweet talkin', just like she Hannah Montana\nHead was clean, 'tony Fantano\nMade her my wife-a, she can't eat 'cause she's so Bella\nConfused erection, bad hoes, no name, brand slave, brainless\n\n\nGhetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty\nFloating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to\nGhetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty\nFloating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to\nGhetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty\nFloating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to\nGhetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty\nFloating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to"

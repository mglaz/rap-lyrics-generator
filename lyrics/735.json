        "\n\n\nNow can we fall in love while Southernplayalistic banging through the night?\nFall in love, through the night\nAnd I ain't ever felt no type of way about this living, do or die\nType of way, do or die\nAnd when they see our age, they say we're young\nI'll let you push me to the side\nPush me to the side\nAt least we fell in love with something greater than debating suicide\nAt least we fell in love\n\n\nHow you feeling, baby?\nHow you feeling, baby?\n\n\nI travel, for you\nI battle, for you\n'Cause I love, to call, your name\nI travel, for you\n\n\nNow can we fall in love while Southernplayalistic banging through the night?\nAnd I ain't ever felt no type of way about this living do or die\nAnd when they see our age, they say we're young\nI'll let you push me to the side\nAt least we fell in love with something greater than debating suicide\n\n\nNow can we fall in love while Southernplayalistic banging through the night?\nFall in love, through the night\nAnd I ain't ever felt no type of way about this living, do or die\nType of way, do or die\nAnd when they see our age, they say we're young, I'll let you push me to the side\nPush me to the side\nAt least I fell in love with something greater than debating suicide\nAt least we fell in love"

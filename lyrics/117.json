        "\n\"I'm saying, you know, like. All I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down. You know, like, you know, grow up. Don't grow down, grow out. You go from being a kid, just doing your thing, hanging out with your friends. Months later you're world famous. You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it. You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler. Fuck you, Tyler!\"\n\n\nWatch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga\nNothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch you, nigga\nNever made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga\nPassing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga\nWe ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch\nI'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch\nBuncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick\nThem young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense\nWe the last of a dying breed\nAnd we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs\nYou stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please\nMy pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees\nBitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing\nNigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person\nWatch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping\nMake actions, fuck rehearsing\n\n\nNigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\nSummer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, 'cause I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\n\n\nIn a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather\nSitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather\nCan name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether\nOr not they got one, tried to change their life for the better\nI was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched\nI was defiant, always said, \"Fuck shit\"\nHated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one\nAlso hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some\nSee I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's\nAnd I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell\nFucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele\nAnd bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille\nI bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well\nI tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself\nThese fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves\nSee, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but\nReally, boy? Posers looking silly, boy\nI'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi\nNot a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese\nNa'kel Smith, Transworld page 64\nPoppin' like oil ollie in fire flames\nI'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game\nThe fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name\nAbout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes\nBut he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists\nGod damn menace, 666 and he's not finished\nAnd my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?\nSee y'all niggas tripping, man\nLook at that article that says my subject matter is wrong\nSaying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs\nLook at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me\nThough I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat\nLook at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind\nBut talk is money, I said, \"Hi,\" I guess I bought him some time\nLook at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?\nThey thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?\nBut then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan\nAnd it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements\nAnd MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing\nBruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings\n\"Analog\" fans are getting sick of the rape\nAll the \"Tron Cat\" fans are getting sick of the lakes\nBut what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints\nBut I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank\nOh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?\nMy fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct\nFuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink\nRecord the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch\n\n\nNigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\nSummer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\n\n\nThis shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering\nSo much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me\nBut Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)\nAll I\u2019m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me\nThat the 40's half off, like you know that cliff\nDon't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)\nOr get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids\nSo maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)\nMalt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and\nAll of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)\nDirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs\nBrother the Pigeons is us\nBid you goodnight and good luck\n(Oh, shut the fuck up!)\n(Gunshot)\n\n\nSamuel's here! Where's Wolf? Fucking faggot. Salem was mine, bitch! Was that good enough, you fucking pussy?"

        "\nEgh, yeah, okay\n\n\nNow, just picture me, high up with my top down\nOn Highland and Sunset, doing 85 on the top deck\nSee, step by step we walking on stars\nIf you're looking for some action, you ain't gotta go that far\n\n\nNow, just picture me Hollywood living\nRiding through the sun, riding through the sunset\nNow, stop tripping, just give me a minute\nAnd wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down\nMan, you know how it go down, man, you know how it go down\nI'll entertain ya, just wait until the sun goes down\nYou know how it go down, you know how it go down\nMight get a little crazy, just wait until the sun goes down\n\n\nUnderground, any city I come in town\nIt's touchdown, Hail Mary, getting to the dough like Pillsbury\nAll night, don't feel worried, high up is where we will be\nNah, you ain't gotta feel guilty, won't judge you, gon' be free\nSo pour what you want, go head, roll what you want\nFuck they say somebody walking 'round here like they somebody\nDon't know what kind of day I had, with all this weight, couldn't hold my bag\nDon't hold me back from my habits, live the fast life for the magic\nI'm just looking 'round for the baddest Hollywood face with an ass from Dallas\nBig-ass crib, nigga living in a palace\nWe rolling out and my hands on the wheel so tight, got a callus\nGet so fabulous with everybody here, only thing that matters\n\n\nNow, just picture me Hollywood living\nRiding through the sun, riding through the sunset\nNow, stop tripping, just give me a minute\nAnd wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down\nMan, you know how it go down, man, you know how it go down\nI'll entertain ya, just wait until the sun goes down\nYou know how it go down, you know how it go down\nMight get a little crazy, just wait until the sun goes down\n\n\nAnd it's go time, I swear this feeling's like we inches from the goal line\nNow or never, better make your mind\nMight hit her with a line like \"What's your sign?\" Hit her with a glass of sparkling wine\nHit her on the ass, she might not mind, acting like a 10, look more like a 9, but\nDon't be stuck up, really, how could you not see us?\nDoing it big, it's obvious, you ain't gotta say much, cause\nI know you're sick and tired, sick and tired of all that bullshit\nThen don't be afraid, take a shot and bite the bullet\nThat's one in the hole, can't get enough, need one or two more\nTell 'em catch up, they're running to slow, out the gutter, I learned to bowl\nAnd finally it's movie time to show them I play the role\nOf a champion, you see the goal, light shine bright, can't see the road\n\n\nNow, just picture me Hollywood living\nRiding through the sun, riding through the sunset\nNow, stop tripping, just give me a minute\nAnd wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down\nJust picture me Hollywood living\nRiding through the sun, riding through the sunset\nNow, stop tripping, just give me a minute\nAnd wait until the sun, wait until the sun goes down\nMan, you know how it go down, man, you know how it go down\nI'll entertain ya, just wait until the sun goes down\nYou know how it go down, you know how it go down\nMight get a little crazy, just wait until the sun goes down"

        "\nWhat if you were a Jehovah's Witness\nThat was merely pretending to be into Christmas\nGathering clues and blending in\nTo take down the holidays from within?\nYou mean like a spy, investigating?\nMaking it seem like I'm celebrating\nWhen actually I'm infiltrating Santa's operation? (Yoip!)\n\n\nGoing deep cover past enemy lines\nMaking everybody think I'm on the Christmas side\nRockin' warm sweaters, hangin' big ass lights\nIf the fat man could see me, yo, it's gotta look right\nI'll watch all the TV specials that I never could\nI'll even cry during the sad ones like James Bond would\nAnd when the big night comes, it's time to set the bait\nCold milk, hot cookies, decorative plates!\nAnd he'll come down the chimney and it will be just him and me\nBut he won't know we're enemies, 'cause I'll play sincere\nBring a trap, like that, hug him tight, get on his lap\nAnd tell him he can come back every year\n'Cause I am Jehovah's most secret witness\nSo I might have to dedicate my life to Christmas\nAnd act just like I love it 'til the day I die\n\n\nA-B-E-D\nConnoisseur of Christmas\nOn the spectrum? None of your business\nThoughts too fast to comprehend\nJust wanna do right by my friend\nIf years were seasons, this December\nWould be the December of our December\nMore blueprints than Howard Hughes\nBut if there are blueprints, how do we choose?\nWe have to be happy to get to the end\nWe have to save Christmas to save our friends\n\n\nWe have to save Christmas to save our friends\nWe have to save Christmas to save our friends!"

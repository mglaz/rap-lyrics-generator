What you say? Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great\nTired of the fuckin' hate, stackin' cheese all on my plate\n\n\nSo outside my misery, I think I'll find\nA way of envisioning a better life\nFor the rest of us, the rest of us\nThere's hope for the rest of us, the rest of us\n\n\nOkay, she keep callin', she keep callin' every single night\nDay and night, on my mind, please don't kill the vibe\nOh no, I swear to God, I be in my mind\nSwear I wanna die, yeah, when you cross my\u2014\nSaid I wanna die, yuh, no, I'm not alright, yuh\nI might start a riot, yuh, I'm so fuckin' tired, yuh\nSo what's up? What you say? Feelin' good, I'm feelin' great\nTired of the fuckin' hate, stackin' cheese all on my plate"

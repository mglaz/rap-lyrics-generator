Roll up, up, and away\nHere we go now\nNow Martin had a dream, I\u2019ve been dreamin\u2019 \u2019bout gold\nTell \u2018em I just wanna shine, and I gotta let it show\nShow up on the scene, walk right through the door\nGot a nigga on repeat, it\u2019s my double up flow\nVibrate the whole building, I ain\u2019t ringing through your phone\nWaiting \u2019til the smoke clear, can you see me through the fog?\nFall back, it could go all bad\nWe be goin\u2019 hard with your ex, oh Tic-tac\nTacky motherfuckers must not be hip yet\nLife is a bitch, but I bet I get that bitch wet\n\n\nWe, we\u2019ve been going hard for too long\nCan\u2019t get enough, what is you on?

I probably sleep\nAnd never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up\nIn God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough\n\n\nThey stomped the homie out over a bitch?\nK-Dot, you good, blood?\nNow we can drop, ye we can drop you back off\nThat nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'\nWe gon' do the same ol' shit\nI'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways\nFall right in ****'s lap\nAnd he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that\nAnd I hope that bitch that set him up out there\nWe gon' pop that bitch too\nWait hold up, ayy, I see somebody\n\nAha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?\nL****, you good?\nYeah, blood, I'm good \u2013 Dave, you good?\nDave? Dave, say somethin' \u2013 Dave?\nThese bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!"

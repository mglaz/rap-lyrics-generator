        "\nYou good, T-Minus?\n\n\nNiggas been countin' me out\nI\u2019m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin\u2019 my clips\nI'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list\nI'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin\u2019 \u2019em hit\nThe real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit\nThe game is off balance, I\u2019m back on my shit\nThe Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty\nBut that's how I like it, you all on my dick\n\n\nI'm all in my bag, this hard as it get\nI do not snort powder, I might take a sip\nI might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip\nI ain\u2019t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish\nI roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death\nI got a few mil' but not all of them rich\nWhat good is the bread if my niggas is broke?\nWhat good is first class if my niggas can't sit?\nThat's my next mission, that's why I can't quit\nJust like LeBron, get my niggas more chips\nJust put the Rollie right back on my wrist\nThis watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift\nBack when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss\nThey act like two legends cannot coexist\nBut I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'\nIf I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit\nIt won't be for clout, it won't be for fame\nIt won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same\nIt won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers\nIt won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane\nEverything grows, it's destined to change\nI love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came\nI hope that you scrape every dollar you can\nI hope you know money won't erase the pain\nTo the OGs, I'm thankin' you now\nWas watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground\nI copied your cadence, I mirrored your style\nI studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now\nFuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice\nNow I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise\nThis year gon' be different, I set my intentions\nI promise to slap all that hate out your voice\n\n\nNiggas been countin' me out\nI'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips\nI'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list\nI'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit\nThe real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit\nThe game is off balance, I'm back on my shit\nThe Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty\nBut that's how I like it, you all on my dick\n\n\nI just poured somethin' in my cup\nI've been wantin' somethin' I can feel\nPromise I am never lettin' up\nMoney in your palm don't make you real\nFoot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck\nI'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel\nIf it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck\nPistol in your hand don't make you real\n\n\nI'm dead in the middle of two generations\nI'm little bro and big bro all at once\nJust left the lab with young 21 Savage\nI'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch\nHad a long talk with the young nigga Kodak\nReminded me of young niggas from 'Ville\nStraight out the projects, no fakin', just honest\nI wish that he had more guidance, for real\nToo many niggas in cycle of jail\nSpending they birthdays inside of a cell\nWe coming from a long bloodline of trauma\nWe raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal\nWe hurting our sisters, the babies as well\nWe killing our brothers, they poisoned the well\nDistorted self-image, we set up to fail\nI'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga\n\n\nI just poured somethin' in my cup\nI've been wantin' somethin' I can feel\nPromise I am never lettin' up\nMoney in your palm don't make you real\nFoot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck\nI'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel\nIf it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck\nPistol in your hand don't make you real\n\n\nMoney in your palm don't make you real\nPistol in your hand don't make you real\nMoney in your palm don't make you real"

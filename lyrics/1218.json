        "\nWhat\nYou and me will always be tight\nFamily every single day and night\nEven when you starts acting like a fool\nYou know I'm loving every single thing you do\n\n\nFuckin' you made me proud of me\n'Cause I know that you doubted me\nEven told me I would never get wit' ya\nTold me I could never get wit' ya\nBut this pride in me\nWouldn't let you slide by me\nThat's when I came back 'round\nI played my game with no respect, I finessed ya to make me seem down but\nI finessed ya, it was all a stresser\nI was your nigga, messed up, fucked your head up\nShoulda never came 'round\nYou let me in and I let you down\nI was wrong 'cause I fucked up the game, baby\nYour name crazy in the streets, got 'em sayin' things\nMy pride was the cause of it all\nI apologize for the flaws in it all, wrongs in it all, 'cause\n\n\nYou and me... always be tight\nFamily every single day and... uh\nAnd even when I starts actin' like a fool\nSomehow I always can fall back on you\nI know my pride, ain't always like myself\nIt's hurtin' you more than anybody else\nAnd every day, what I try not to do\nIs let my pride get between me and you\n\n\nBaby, I shoulda listened when you told me\nI would do better as a homie, yeah\nRight there, I shoulda took a note\nBut pride was buggin' on me\nI shouldn't, I shouldn't make excuses now\n'Cause I know that it's useless now\nYou know what the truth is now\nYou swear you know how I do shit now\nSo I'll be gone 'til November\nTalkin' old Timberlands in the winter\nWith this .5 on my side and my .40\nYou moved on but you still are my shawty\nI don't wanna lie because I'm right wit' ya\nYou always pick me up, I don't get ya\nI been tryna find your heart, I'm still tryin'\nYou can find someone else but you're still mine, 'cause\n\n\nYou and me... always be tight\nFamily every single day and... uh\nAnd even when I starts actin' like a fool\nSomehow I always can fall back on you\nKnow my pride, ain't always like myself\nIt's hurtin' you more than anybody else\nAnd every day, what I try not to do\nIs let my pride get between me and you"

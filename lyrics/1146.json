        "\n\n\nI fuck with savages, you a fuckboy, you can't hang\nYou can find me posted up on Frank block with my fuckin' gang\nYou ain't really 'bout shit, stay out my...\nCocky\n(Let's get it)\n(Let's get it)\nGang and his bitch\nSlim Jesus in a cut\n(Let's get it)\n(Boom, boom, boom, boom)\n\n\nI fuck with savages, you a fuckboy, you can't hang\nYou can find me posted up on Frank block with my fuckin' gang\nYou ain't really 'bout shit, stay out my spot, don't speak my name\nOr I pull up on your block at night, wearing all black and let that 40 bang\nI fucked your girl and I ain't even try to, that little hoe, she a fuckin' thot\nGot her off the Molly, now she rollin', all she good for is giving top\nI got loud pack, I got school buses, hurry up fam, come and shop\nI got a big 40 with a thirty-clip, and I call that bitch my fuckin' mop\nI paid 350 for a Fendi belt, and that double F hold up my strap\nA lot of y'all just Twitter flex but this shit ain't just a fuckin' rap\nI hear one diss and I'm running up in your fuckin' trap\nYou thought shit was sweet 'til I ran up with no fuckin' mask\nAlways chasing a check, bitch I'm really 'bout mine\nYou a broke boy but you rock designer, that shit don't sound right\nThought you could sneak diss and you won't get found, right?\n'Til you get caught in traffic, at the wrong place, at the wrong time\n\n\nGot a couple shooters and they ride with me\nAnd they down to shoot when it's drill time\nPull up and we get to drumming\nLet thirty shots out that Glock nine\nGot a couple shooters and they ride with me\nAnd they down to shoot when it's drill time\nPull up and we get to drumming\nLet thirty shots out that Glock nine\n\n\nNow it's back to the trap with a twenty sack\nRolling up a swisher of that straight gas\nGot a fifty-clip sticking out the MAC\nSo that's fifty shots for your goofy ass\nCopped a Ferragamo when I was up at Saks\nBut my True Religions still off my ass\nI got heavy pockets, I got big ass bands\nRun up on me tryna rob, and that thirty blap\nKeep a bankroll on me at all times, rolled up with a rubber band\nOff the lean, that Promethazine got me walking around like a kick stand\nKeep a burner tucked on my right side, my .380 or my FN\nAnd if I catch you lacking, better pray to God that my shit jam\nB-but if it don't, I'ma take you out like a fuckin' date\nPut a hole in your fuckin' back if I catch you talkin' to the fuckin' Jakes\nAin't afraid to catch a body and skip out from state to state\nAnd if there's a witness, I'ma kill 'em too and I'ma beat the case\nLet's get it!\n\n\n(Let's get it)\n(Let's get it...)"

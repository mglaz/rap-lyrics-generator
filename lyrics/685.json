        "\nTen\nOZ on the track\nGang\nAyy\nI just been feelin' different lately man\nI been pouring eighths every day and popping bottles in the stu' and shit\n\n\nSome my niggas got years of they life took from them\nAnd I just wanna see all of mine\nAbout half of my niggas they not even here\nPour a Four up it keep me from crying\nDoing shows made me miss Grandma birthday this year\nWho I don't even see all the time\nTrying to balance out family and my career\nAll I really want is peace of mind (All I really want is peace of mind)\n\n\nAll I really want is peace of mind (All I really want is peace of mind)\nI'm so deep in the streets know some secrets I won't ever tell that could get me some time\nSeen so much in my life I got demons in me I don't fight I just keep em inside\nAin't no fear if you seek I won't hide\nHardcore guaranteed I'ma ride\nGrowing up I had poor nigga dreams just to be on TV shooting threes throwing dimes\nThen I learned wait oh no no nigga dreams will chase yours, what I just spent on drink was a dime\nUsed to live in the slums, dishes all in the sink, none to eat cry and sleep all the time\nNow I live in three states and I fly to LA to get high on the beach all the time\nAnd I hate coming back cause when I'm in Chi-raq gotta ride with them  heats all the time\nNiggas say they want me all the time (What?)\nLord Father God forgive me for the sins I commit all the time\nGotta load up that clip all the time\nI can't repent all the time\n\n\nSome my niggas got years of they life took from them\nAnd I just wanna see all of mine\nAbout half of my niggas they not even here\nPour a Four up it keep me from crying\nDoing shows made me miss Grandma birthday this year\nWho I don't even see all the time\nTrying to balance out family and my career\nAll I really want is peace of mind (All I really want is peace of mind)\n\n\nDoing shows made me miss Grandma birthday this year\nWho I don't even see all the time\nMy whole family pray I stay safe everyday they be checking on me all the time\nAnd I swear man I hate seeing tears on their face\nKeep two hammers on me all the time\nWhy it got to be my life at risk everyday?\nType of shit that I think all the time\nBut it is what it is I'll be fine\nUntil then I'ma get dollar signs\nNiggas killing for Neims and they killing for fame and I'm like\nWhen they gonna get dollar signs?\nUsed to sleep in the streets didn't see OG for weeks and won't come back until I get dollar signs\nAnd that's by any means for my family to see every meal I'ma miss some of mine\nYeah put that on my life cause that's all I know\nWhen I write I don't fake not a line\nTell myself I'm the truth all the time\nGrandma hit me on the phone ask me what I'ma do all the time\nTold her just trying to stay out the way cause I think about you all the time\n\n\nSome my niggas got years of they life took from them\nAnd I just wanna see all of mine\nAbout half of my niggas they not even here\nPour a Four up it keep me from crying\nDoing shows made me miss Grandma birthday this year\nWho I don't even see all the time\nTrying to balance out family and my career\nAll I really want is peace of mind (All I really want is peace of mind)"

        "\nCross my heart, hope to die\nTo my lover, I'd never lie\nHe said \"be true,\" I swear I'll try\nIn the end, it's him and I\nHe's out his head, I'm out my mind\nWe got that love, the crazy kind\nI am his, and he is mine\nIn the end, it's him and I, him and I\n\n\nMy '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride\nThey don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide\n2017 Bonnie and Clyde\nWouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah\nGot that kind of style everybody try to rip off\nYSL dress under when she takes the mink off\nSilk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off\nEver catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)\nCrazy, but I love her, I could never run from her\nHit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her\nSwear we drive each other, man, she be so stubborn\nBut, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?\nIntense, this shit, it gets dense\nShe knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense\nIf I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents\nShe'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (You know?)\n\n\nCross my heart, hope to die (Uh)\nTo my lover, I'd never lie (I love you baby)\nHe said, \"Be true,\" I swear I'll try\nIn the end, it's him and I\nHe's out his head, I'm out my mind\nWe got that love; the crazy kind\nI am his, and he is mine\nIn the end, it's him and I\n\n\nHim and I\nOh-oh-oh-oh-woah\nOh-oh-oh-oh-woah\nIn the end, it's him and I\nHim and I\nOh-oh-oh-oh-woah\nOh-oh-oh-oh-woah\nIn the end, it's him and I\n\n\nWe turn up, mobbin' 'til the end of time\nOnly one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini\nRemember this for when I die\nEverybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie\nMy funeral will be lit if I-\nEver go down or get caught, or they identify\nMy bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify\nShe would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy\nEver tell you different, then it's a lie\nSee, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier\nShe keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there\nCalm and collected, she keeps her composure\nAnd she gon' ride for me until this thing over\nWe do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)\nAnd we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever\nYou know? We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch\nFuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?\n\n\nCross my heart, hope to die\nTo my lover, I'd never lie\nHe said \"be true,\" I swear I'll try\nIn the end, it's him and I\nHe's out his head, I'm out my mind\nWe got that love; the crazy kind\nI am his, and he is mine\nIn the end, it's him and I\n\n\nHim and I\nOh-oh-oh-oh-woah\nOh-oh-oh-oh-woah\nIn the end, it's him and I\nHim and I\nOh-oh-oh-oh-woah\nOh-oh-oh-oh-woah\nIn the end, it's him and I\n\n\nCross my heart, hope to die\nTo you, I've never lied\nFor you, I'd take a life\nIt's him and I, and I swear (Ayy)\n'Til the end I'ma ride wit' you\nMob and get money, get high wit' you, yeah (Ayy)\nCross my heart, hope to die\nThis is our ride or die\nYou can confide in me\nThere's not no hiding, I swear\nStay solid, never lie to you\nSwear, most likely I'ma die wit' you, yeah\n\n\nCross my heart, hope to die\nTo my lover, I'd never lie\nHe said, \u201cBe true,\u201d I swear I'll try\nIn the end, it's him and I\nHe's out his head, I'm out my mind\nWe got that love, the crazy kind\nI am his, and he is mine\nIn the end, it's him and I\n\n\nHim and I\nOh-oh-oh-oh-woah\nOh-oh-oh-oh-woah\nIn the end, it's him and I\nHim and I\nOh-oh-oh-oh-woah\nOh-oh-oh-oh-woah\nIn the end, it's him and I"

        "\nThey say boys don't cry\nBut your dad has shed a lot of tears\nThey say I should be a strong man\nBut baby, I'm still filled with fear\nSometimes I don't know who I am\nSometimes I question why I'm here\nI just wanna be a good dad\nWill I be? I have no idea\nThey say girls shouldn't be tough\nAnd moms should raise their kids at home\nBut baby, I know that that isn't true\nCause your momma's the toughest person I know\nI wanna raise you to be like her\nAnd watch you show the world how to do it on your own\nI'm still tryna figure out who I am\nI don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong\nI'm gonna be there for your first breath\nI don't know if I'll be there for your first step\nI can promise you that I'll try to work less\nBut the tour's routed, and I got this album\nPut in so many hours, and I just want the outcome\nTo be something that I can look back and I can be proud of\nDon't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime\nBut I got a world to sing to and you at the same time\nI won't spoil you, you can trust that\nFor your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass\nHad your heart broken? Been there, done that\nI love you and I can't give you enough of that\nGive back to community that raised you up\nRead Langston Hughes, I suggest \"A Raisin in the Sun\"\nListen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come\nYou put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love\nDon't try to change the world, find something that you love\nAnd do it every day\nDo that for the rest of your life\nAnd eventually, the world will change\n\n\nI'll be patient, one more month\nYou'll wrap your fingers round my thumb\nTimes are changing, I know\nBut who am I if I'm the person you become\nIf I'm still growing up, up, up, up\nI'm still growing up, up, up, up\nI'm still growing up\n\n\nI recommend that you read \"The Alchemist\"\nListen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus\nTell the truth, regardless of the consequence\nAnd every day, give your momma a compliment\nTake your girl to the prom\nBut don't get too drunk hanging out the limo\nSlow dance with your woman in your arms\nSneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe\nDon't wake your mom up\nDo yoga, learn 'bout karma\nFind God, but leave the dogma\nThe quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless\nAsk more questions, talk about yourself less\nStudy David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac\nWatch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop\nWear a helmet, don't be stupid\nJaywalk, but look before you do it\nIf it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help\nGet a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts\nGo to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance\nYou're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance\nTake risks, cause life moves so fast\nYou're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance\n\n\nI'll be patient, one more month\nYou'll wrap your fingers round my thumb\nTimes are changing, I know, but who am I if\nI'm the person you become\nIf I'm still growing up, up, up, up\nI'm still growing up, up, up, up\n\n\nI'll be patient, one more month\nYou'll wrap your fingers round my thumb\nTimes are changing, I know\nBut who am I if I'm the person you become\nIf I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up\nIf I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up\n\n\nI'm still growing up\nI'm still growing up, ooh\nI'm still growing up\nI'm still growing up"

        "\nYou know I'm back, like I never left (I never left)\nAnother sprint, another step (Another step)\nAnother day, another breath (Another breath)\nBeen chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)\nI got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind\nSeek and I find, I can sleep when I die\nWant a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride\nAnd shit I'm straight, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave\nGet out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?\nI heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave\nAnd the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name\nSo when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?\nDid I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?\nLegend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria\nTrudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us\nGot 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors\nMy mama told me never bow your head, woo\n\n\nI feel glorious, glorious\nGot a chance to start again\nI was born for this, born for this\nIt's who I am, how could I forget?\nI made it through the darkest part of the night\nAnd now I see the sunrise\nNow I feel glorious, glorious\nI feel glorious, glorious\n\n\nI'm feeling glorious\nThe crib looking Victorian (Oh yes it is)\nYou know that we been going in (Been going in)\nSince we hopped out that DeLorean (DeLorean, yeah we win)\nEn garde, things are just things, they don't make you who you are\nCan't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone\nWe posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars\nMy grandma smiling down on me like \"Woo, that boy got bars\"\nOkay, okay, yes I do\nI said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too\nAnother morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way\nI got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came, woo\n\n\nI feel glorious, glorious\nGot a chance to start again\nI was born for this, born for this\nIt's who I am, how could I forget?\nI made it through the darkest part of the night\nAnd now I see the sunrise\nNow I feel glorious, glorious\nI feel glorious, glorious\n\n\nWe gon' be alright, put that on my life\nWhen I open my eyes, hope I see you shine\nWe're planting a flag, they don't understand\nThe world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)\nWe gon' be alright, put that on my life\nWhen I open my eyes, hope I see you shine\nWe're planting a flag, they don't understand\nThe world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)\n\n\nI feel glorious, glorious\nGot a chance to start again\nI was born for this, born for this\nIt's who I am, how could I forget?\nI made it through the darkest part of the night\nAnd now I see the sunrise\nNow I feel glorious, glorious\nI feel glorious, glorious"

        "\nI might go Interstellar\nI feel like Matthew McConaughey\nI don't care for what they gotta say\nTony Perkis how I drop the weight\nJason Bourne with the headshot\nJason Statham with the whip game\nLiam Neeson with the rescue\nI go Gunnar with the leather face\nBruce Campbell with the chains\nTobin Bell with the saw\nAnthony Hopkins, I'm eatin' 'em raw\nThey don't know who we are\nMolly Shannon I'm a superstar\nRide or die like it's Seabiscuit\nTryna stack like Tobey\nJohn Wick, I don't leave a witness\nChris Paul, I'm assistin'\nAmeer go Blake Griffin\nGive me forty-eight minutes\nWe go '04 Pistons\nCatch a fade like Robert Horry\nOnly time to get the spotlight\nDeray how I'm top flight\nGo Obama when I drop mics\n\n\nI'm the black Tom Hanks\nYou can call me Nigga Banks\nSecret Agent Cody Banks\nQuarter pound of the dank\nOn the scale and it stank\nPut my mama in a Range\nI just bought a new Wraith\nNic Cage with the face off\nJohn Travolta when I take off\nBrad Pitt, start a fight club\nTurn the trap into the nightclub\nI'm like Prince with the white doves\nPaint a picture with the white dust\nLionel Richie with the white bitch\nTry to tell it to her nicely but she never wanna listen\nBeat the pussy to submission\nTom Cruise on a mission\nPull a R&B singer, bring her back to South Central\nI shine just like a popstar, MJ my initial\nKobe Bryant with the spin moves\nIf these niggas got issues\nH-Town with Beyonc\u00e9, turn her to my prom date\nKingpin like JAY-Z, dance moves like JT\n\n\nHeath Ledger with some dreads\nI just gave my nigga head\nStanding on my two legs\nFuck what that nigga done said\nBruh, I don't fuck with no white boys\n'less the nigga Shawn Mendes\nI been off and I been dead\nBad as hell, I don't bench press\nHigh school they ain't fuck with me\nNow the critics don't fuck with me\nMy own fam ain't fuck with me\nBut Viceland did fuck with me\nI'm the only popstar with no money\nCan't drive, so I'm still running\nUber takin' all my show money\nBut that's okay, I got more money\nNot enough to get my teeth fixed\nSo my boyfriend in the street, bitch\nIn the moonlight, I get seasick\nDid ya see all the art that we did?\nDid all that shit in a weekend\nWe was up all late tweakin', yeah\nIce Cube on a Friday, Chris Tucker on a Friday\nMichael Cera on a Friday, Jonah Hill on a Friday\nRockin' Leo's blood diamonds\nSucked off on the highway\nPolice right behind me like a nigga stole his OJ\nOkay, I don't play, got the same last name as O.J."

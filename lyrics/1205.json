        "\nMetro Boomin want some more, nigga\n\n\nI've been running from my problems\nI've been running from you\nGirl, all this money, all these things don't feel the same without you\nI can't trust these others girls, I got a feeling 'bout you\nEven though I'm doing well, I lose my touch without you\nI hate to hurt you, cameras showing everything that I do\nPiece of shit, I got a side bitch and I lie to her too\nMy mama asking 'bout you, and I'm finna lie to her too\nI blew up and got lost in the sauce, and changed up on you\n\n\nBut when nobody else was around\nShe always held me down\nShe always held me down\nShe always held me down\nWay before I found my sound\nShe kept my feet on the ground\nShe always held me down\nShe always held me down\n\n\nI've been living life on the road\nFeeling lonely, heart is turning cold\nI be covered up in sold-out clothes\nFeeling empty, doing sold-out shows\nUse the drugs to cover up my emotions (abusing drugs)\nEvery time you see me, I'm either rolling or smoking (I'm rollin' up)\nEverybody love me now, only you make me feel important\nWhen we settle down, everything you buy gon' be imported\nAll of your friends, they told you, \"Don't fuck with a artist\"\nWhen I tell you what my body count is, that gon hit you the hardest\n\n\nI've been running from my problems\nI've been running from you\nGirl, all this money, all these things don't feel the same without you\nI can't trust these others girls, I got a feeling 'bout you\nEven though I'm doing well, I lose my touch without you\nI hate to hurt you, cameras showing everything that I do\nPiece of shit, I got a side bitch and I lie to her too\nMy mama asking 'bout you, and I'm finna lie to her too\nI blew up and got lost in a sauce, and changed up on you\n\n\nBut when nobody else was around\nShe always held me down\nShe always held me down\nShe always held me down\nWay before I found my sound\nShe kept my feet on the ground\nShe always held me down\nShe always held me down\n\n\nWhenever they took my music for a joke\nWhenever I ever had my back against the ropes\nWhen I was down and out with no hope\nShe was always down from the get-go\nShe was always down, stayed ten toes\nLost my girl, found a thousand hoes\nShe a good girl, don't work on a pole\nIf I need it, she would stash my pole\nShe paid for all the dinners when I was broke\nIf I needed, she would hide my dope\nGirl, I know you still wearing my clothes\nI know you think about me when you're alone\nI know you think about texting my phone\nI wish you would give in and just let go\nI'm happy I found out you was at my show\nYou're more than my girl\nYou're part of my soul\n\n\nI've been running from my problems\nI've been running from you\nGirl, all this money, all these things don't feel the same without you\nI can't trust these others girls, I got a feeling 'bout you\nEven though I'm doing well, I lose my touch without you\nI hate to hurt you, cameras showing everything that I do\nPiece of shit, I got a side bitch and I lie to her too\nMy mama asking 'bout you, and I'm finna lie to her too\nI blew up and got lost in a sauce, and changed up on you\n\n\nBut when nobody else was around\nShe always held me down\nShe always held me down\nShe always held me down\nWay before I found my sound\nShe kept my feet on the ground\nShe always held me down\nShe always held me down"

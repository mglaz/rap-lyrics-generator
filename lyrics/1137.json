Shorty what you need?\nMy niggas run the game, we ain't ever leavin'\nCountin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'\nYou got V12, I got 12 Vs\nGot bottles, got weed, got molly (I'm all the way up)\nShorty what you want? I got what you need\nShorty what you want? I got what you need\nShorty what you want? I got what you need\n\n\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nAll the way up\nNothin' can stop me, I'm all the way up\n\n\nFor my niggas with Bentley coupes and Rolexes\nKicked the bitch out the room and gave her no breakfast\nHad to stash the jewels, these bitches so reckless\nKeep my hoes on cruise, I'm talkin' naughty nothings\nShorty uptown showin' off her new things\nCouldn't take it all so I gave her un chin\nShe call me top shotta, yeah I keep a few tings\nChampion sound, yeah I got a few rings\nAnd I'm all the way up\nAnd you can stay up\nAnd if you ask anybody where I live\nThey'll point to the hills and say\nGo all the way up\nGo all the way up\n\n\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nNothin' can stop me, I'm all the way up\n\n\nJust left the big house to a bigger house\nAin't have a girlfriend, but the bitch is out\nChanel croc bag, shit ain't even out\nWith the gold chains, Himalayan, Birkin cocaine\nLit it up, Pac shit, I hit 'em up\nI'm talkin' color money, purple yen and blue dirham\nI got brown lira, I ain't talkin' 'bout Ross bitch\nI'm that nigga on Viagra dick\nThat means I'm all the way up\nAnd you can stay up\nP.O.s say I can't get high\nHopped in the helicopter Uber and said\nGo all the way up\nGo all the way up\n\n\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nNothin' can stop me, I'm all the way up\n\n\nShorty what you want? Shorty what you need?\nMy niggas run the game, we ain't ever leavin'\nCountin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'\nYou got V12, I got 12 Vs\nGot bottles, got weed, got molly (I'm all the way up)\nShorty what you want? I got what you need\nShorty what you want? I got what you need\nShorty what you want? I got what you need\n\n\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nNothin' can stop me, I'm all the way up\nAll the way up\nI'm all the way up\nI'm all the way up\nNothin' can stop me, I'm all the way up"

        "\n\n\nThese niggas take me for granted, what would hap' if I vanish?\nBet a hunnid they'd panic, my shooters only speak Spanish\nKeep my heart with my dogs, keep my car in the yard\nI can't drive it nowhere so I'll let you niggas take off\nSeen the shit that they drop, that shit not instantly hot\nI give that instant re-bop, that replay value go off\nThat make my value go up, I keep that bow in my cup\nMy niggas rolling, got that going with a thousand to bust\nThat nigga Kevin can't rap, he too sappy with his shit\nHe don't rep me with his shit, he on that teenage bullshit\nAnd he 'bout 20 and shit? When he let go of that shit?\nHe'll prolly be a little colder, y'all agree with me? Shit\nThat nigga need to act his age, he ain't acting like a grown up\nAin't that boy from Texas? He ain't acting like a soldier\nKnew that boy in high school, man, that nigga wasn't awkward\nAnd I know his mama, man, that nigga just a liar\n\n\nCash don't last, my friends will ride with me\nKeep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine\nWhen the guns go pow, won't bother us again\nI don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me\n\n\nCash don't mean shit, shit\nCrashed my last Benz, Benz\nCashed my last check, check\nCash don't mean shit, shit\nCash don't mean shit, shit\nCrashed my last Benz, Benz\nCashed my last check, check\nCash don't mean shit, shit\n\n\nCall me King of the niggas, I need a crown made of thorns\nGod said, \"Let there be light\" on the day I was born\nStep off the ship with the slaves, then I go hit the stage\nI just left in a whip, all I need is a chain\nI don't trust no niggas and I don't trust no bitch\n'Cause people talk too much, I bought a black fo'-fifth\nAnd a brand new clip, that's my new best friend\n'Cause I'm a brand new nigga, in a brand new crib\nI ain't sellin' no more, but got my hand in the zip\nWhitey gave me the check, I ain't ask for the fame\nI used to deal with the grams 'til they put the cam on my face\nNow I'm evading the law, I'm on a high-speed chase\nI'm in a big-ass truck, I tell 'em, \"Get out the way\"\nI gotta couple of warrants, so I'm leaving my state\nNow I'm in Cali today, with the sun on my face\nI got a bag of the gas, and a blunt I can face\n\n\nHow I'm gon' move at your pace? I'm busy settin' the tone\nYou think we runnin' together? I'm in a lane of my own\nDon't got no friends in this game, it's me and my brothers alone\nThey thinkin' that we competing, that shit depletin' my bones\nI don't need all that energy, they just fuck up my chakras\nI put my heart in a locker, they love me when I'm a martyr\nThey hate me when I'm myself, I can't barter with that\nYou watch us charter these tracks, it's sticking like tartar and plaque\nI need a parlour of plaques, need lobsters and helicopters\nI need peace for my niggas, need darker skin for all my doctors\nI like to speak like a scholar, like to think like a nigga\nIn this world I can't wander, no honor behind the trigger\nI could get shot in my back and they'd tell the world that I fought 'em\n\"We ain't taught 'em nothin' new, but somehow they been gettin' smarter\"\nThat's what they sayin' in private, speaking from that entitlement\nWe still workin' for titles and makin' tidal environments\n\n\nCash don't last, my friends will ride with me\nKeep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine\nWhen the guns go pow, won't bother us again\nI don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me\nCash don't last, my friends will ride with me\nKeep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine\nWhen the guns go pow, won't bother us again\nI don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me\n\n\nFuck, put ya ante up, riding in the limousine\nI'm stuck on some bud I hit, under concrete canopy\nFuck all this energy, you just wanna bring me down\nFuck all your energy, you just wanna bring me down\nFuck, put the windows up, blowin' past the exit now\nUp like a money shot, swerve into the sunset\nMe and all my boys jet, swerving like a doughnut\nOff, off, off, off, swerving like a doughnut\n\n\nNigga, what?\nPull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to\nNigga, what?\nPull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to\nNigga, what?\nPull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to\nNigga, what? Y-yo"

        "\nAyy, you got me fucked up if you think I'ma fuck up this time, alright\nIt's the kid, come on, ayy\n\n\nI rock the tan cargos with the velcro seams\nI can't feel the vibration when my cell phone ring\nI like to watch them split the swisher, make the 'rillo bleed\nI know that Sunny keep a pound inside the L.L. Bean\nAnd this that wasted youth, killing time\nSay the truth, feel the vibe\nBaby let me bring you 'round my friends, yeah, they the purest\nI might act a little different that's just 'cause they give me courage\nWhen I need it\nI mean I'm joking but I'm not\nYeah the story of my life, said I play too fucking much\nAnd I say that way too much, guess that still don't justify it\nBut I been that way forever, I don't feel like even trying to change\nShe the one I'm tryna' be real with\nBut this that tick-tock, she ain't got no time for my feelings\nI need a pit stop every time I ride with my villains\nThey up in Big Rock blowing smoke inside the pavilion, you know\n\n\nWasted youth, killing time\nSay the truth, feel the vibe\nWasted youth\nWasted youth\nWasted youth\nWasted youth\n\n\nWasted youth, wasted time\nWish that I could press rewind\nDon't fuck with sunshine, stuck in my confines\nYeah, I'm worried 'bout real shit, you worried 'bout punchlines\nAnd I was coolin' with my niggas\nTalking 'bout stacking them figures\nWasting my time with them bitches\nChilling, kicking, she gon' stuff them swishers\nAnd I don't even smoke for real but I'ma puff it with her\nAnd we gon' fuck and I ain't gon' see her for a couple weekends\n'Cause I been drinking, I been smoking, going off the deep end\nShe said that she gon' be my baby well I guess it depends\nCatch me faded maybe we can see then, maybe we can be friends\nIf we don't hit it off, I'm sorry\nLately, I been distant, you can cut this shit off\nI just been lost in my thoughts\nWasted money, chasing truth\nWasted time, wasted youth\n\n\nWasted youth, killing time\nSay the truth, feel the vibe\nWasted youth\nWasted youth\nWasted youth\nWasted youth"

        "\nRun that back, Turbo\n\n\nYou can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it\nI gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'\nI bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em\nTakin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'\nThat ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it\nIf I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'\nThe backend just came in, in all hundreds\nVibes galore, cute shit, they all on us\nI'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit\nI know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments\nWhenever I tell her to come, she comin'\nWhenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'\n\n\nDrip too hard, don't stand too close\nYou gon' fuck around and drown off this wave\nDoin' all these shows, I've been on the road\nI don't care where I go, long as I get paid\nBad lil' vibe, she been on my mind\nSoon as I get back, she gettin' slayed\nDo this all the time, this ain't no surprise\nEvery other night, another movie gettin' made\nDrip too hard, don't stand too close\nYou gon' fuck around and drown off this wave\nDoin' all these shows, I've been on the road\nI don't care where I go, long as I get paid\nBad lil' vibe, she been on my mind\nSoon as I get back, she gettin' slayed\nDo this all the time, this ain't no surprise\nEvery other night, another movie gettin' made\n\n\nYeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made\nEvery other night started with a good day\nI feel like a child, I got boogers in the face\nDiamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade\nI don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave\nI had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved\nTSA harass me, so I took a private plane\nThese pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim\nDrip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)\nDesigner to the ground, I can barely spell the names\nDrip too hard, caution on the floor\nYou gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave\n\n\nDrip too hard, don't stand too close\nYou gon' fuck around and drown off this wave\nDoin' all these shows, I've been on the road\nI don't care where I go, long as I get paid\nBad lil' vibe, she been on my mind\nSoon as I get back, she gettin' slayed\nDo this all the time, this ain't no surprise\nEvery other night, another movie gettin' made\nDrip too hard, don't stand too close\nYou gon' fuck around and drown off this wave\nDoin' all these shows, I've been on the road\nI don't care where I go, long as I get paid\nBad lil' vibe, she been on my mind\nSoon as I get back, she gettin' slayed\nDo this all the time, this ain't no surprise\nEvery other night, another movie gettin' made"

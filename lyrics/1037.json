        "\n\"Roxanne, feel it!\"\n\n\nWell, my name is Roxanne, a-don't ya know\nI just a-cold rock a party, and I do this show\nI said I met these three guys, and you know that's true\nA-let me tell you and explain them all to you:\nI met this dude with the name of a hat\nI didn't even walk away, I didn't give him no rap\nBut then he got real mad, and he got a little tired\nIf he worked for me, you know he would be fired\nHis name is Kangol, and that is cute\nHe ain't got money, and he ain't got the loot\nAnd every time that I see him, he's always a-beggin'\nAnd all the other girls that he's always tryin' to leggin'\nEvery time that he sees me, he says a rhyme\nBut, see, compared to me it's weak compared to mine\nA-every time I know that I am sayin' somethin' fresher\nIn any category I'm considered the best\nAnd every time that I say it there ain't nothin' less\nAnd everybody knows I will win the contest\nSo, then, after that came The Educated Rapper\nHis fingers started snappin', and my hands start to clappin'\nEvery time-a that I see him, everything he say\nA-every time he says, he says it dumber this way:\nHe said-a, \"Yeah, you know your mother's name is Mary,\"\nBut all he want to do is just-a bust a cherry\nEvery time that I see him, he's sayin' somethin' new\nBut let me explain to him what he should do:\nHe should be like me, a fly MC\nDon't never have to bite, we're always right\nI have the freshest rhymes that I do recite\nAnd after that, and you know it's true\nWell, let me tell you somethin' else about the Doctor, too:\nHe ain't really cute, and he ain't great\nHe don't even know how to operate\nHe came up to me with some bullshit rap\nBut let me tell you somethin'; don't you know it was wack\nSo when he came up to me, I told him to step back\nHe said, \"You call yourself an MC?\" I said, \"This is true,\"\nHe said, \"Explain to me really what MCs must do.\"\nI said, \"Listen very close cause I don't say this every day:\nMy name is Roxanne, and they call me Shant\u00e9.\"\nBut every time-a I say a rhyme-a just-a like-a this-a\nIt's something that you MCs just won't-a miss-a\nAnd if you think it's cute-a, and you think it's all right\nBut, see, you said it in a language so you wouldn't have to bite\nYou started talkin' Pig Latin, didn't make no sense\nYou thought you was cute, yeah, you thought you was a prince\nYou're walkin' down the block, a-holdin' your jock\nBut everybody knows that you're all on my yacht\nI'm just the devastatin', always rockin', always have the niggas clockin'\nEverybody knows it's me, yeah, the R-O-X-A-N-N-E, yeah\nDown with everybody fresh and everyone that I possess\nAnd every time I do it right-a, everyone is sure to bite-a\nEvery time I do it, yeah, you know it is-a me-a\nRockin' on the beat-a that you can see\nAnd every time I have a DJ like Ice\nHe ain't right, yeah, he ain't nice\nBecause a-everything he does is off-the-wall\nCompared to my man Marley Marl\nThe way he gets on the tables, yes\nEveryone knows that he is fresh\nSo, the UTFO crew, you know what you can do\nLemme tell you one for me, and then I'll tell you one for you\nEvery time you sayin' somethin' just-a like-a this-a\nIt ain't nothin' that I don't want to miss-a\nAnd if you're thinkin' that I'm bitin' your beat\nWell, then you just better know, and a-listen to me\nBecause my name is Roxanne-a, and I came to say\nI'm rockin' to the beat-a, and I do it every day\nI'm conceited, never beated, never heard of defeated\nI'm rockin' to the beat-a, and you know it is-a me-a:\nThe R-O-X-A-N-N-E-a\nAnd if you want to play a little game for me\nLemme show you what you can do, baby\n'Cause with a twist of my cheek, and a twist of my wrist\nI have all the niggas droppin' down like this\nYeah, I am fly but don't take this\nAnd everybody knows I don't go for it\nSo, if you're tryin' to be cute and you're tryin' to be fine\nYou need to cut it out 'cause it's all in your mind\nTryin' to be like me, yeah, is very hard\nYou think you are God, but you do eat lard\nTryin' to be cute, and you're tryin' to be fly\nDon't you know you wish you could be my guy?\nSo I can take you home, make you relax\nAnd everybody knows that you're out there, tryin' to tax\nLike corn-on-the-cob, you're always tryin' to rob\nYou need to be out there, get yourself a job\nYeah, you're tryin' to be in search of a Roxanne\nBut lemme let ya know--you're not a real man\nCause a Roxanne needs a man, and yes:\nSomeone fresh who always address\nSomeone, yeah, who will never fess\nAnd then I'll say, yeah, the rest\nCause everybody knows how the story goes\nThere's no ifs, no ands, no buts, or suppose\nNo coke up your nose, no dope in your vein\nAnd then it won't cause no kind of pain\nBut yet, and still, you're tryin' to be fly\nI ask you a question, I want to know why:\nWhy'd ya have to make a record 'bout me\nThe R-O-X-A-N-N-E?\n\n\n(\"Roxanne, Roxanne, \nI want to be your man\nRoxanne, Roxanne\nAnd here's our game-plan!\")"

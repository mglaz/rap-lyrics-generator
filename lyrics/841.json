        "\nIt's a lot been going on mane\nKnow what I'm sayin'?\nTime for me to address this shit\nTired of hearing about it\nLet's go, yeah\n\n\n(These hoes) They for everybody\nPass them all around, they at every party\nThey ain't gon be loyal, not for anybody\nStill I love these hoes\n(These hoes) They for everybody\nOh, that was your girl? Oops, I'm sorry\nDon't bring her around, this just too much money\nYeah I love these hoes\n\n\nShe's a super freak, super freak\nMet her in Liv last week\nShe was in there with Meek\nIn VIP, then she left with me\nShe said she fuck with Breezy\nDo I wanna keep it? Nah, that ho too sleazy\nNow she fuck with Jeezy\nDon't believe me? The shit's all over TV\nNow she work the pole, but you ain't know\nThat's how she make her dough\nSeen her in New York\nShe was all throwed, forgot we met before\nShe say she fuck with Drake\nI ain't surprised, all these hoes fucking with Drake\nI asked why she out this way\nSaid she on a date, then she left with Trey\nWhen will niggas learn?\nHoes like a doorknob, everybody gets a turn\nChicks be so high-class on the internet\nBut don't got shit she earned\nShe got that bag from Juicy J\nShe got that ass from Rudy Gay\nNow your silly ass down on one knee\nFuck man, is you cray?\n\n\nThese hoes\nThey for everybody\nPass them all around, they at every party\nThey ain't gon be loyal, not for anybody\nStill I love these hoes\nThese hoes They for everybody\nOh, that was your girl? Oops, I'm sorry\nDon't bring her around, this just too much money\nYeah I love these hoes\n\n\nMan, I fell in love with a stripper\nFunny thing is I fell back out of love quicker\nThey don't pay attention to love anyway\nThey only concerned with what the haters say\nBottles be turnin these girls into thots\nInstagram turnin these wifes into hoes\nNo real life they just readin the comments\nMess with a real one and get you exposed\nI had a time when my mind was caught up\nMy niggas was lookin like what is he on\nMy family was too scared to talk to a nigga\nAin't comin back now the case just got closed\nShe do what she told\nSharin' is carin' that pussy ain't gold\nSorry you ain't in control\nYou all about that money, thats shit that I throw\nJust make sure you clean off that pole\nThey turn on the TV and get on the gram\nAnd say that's relationship goals\nTrust me don't save em' anything goes with...\n\n\nThese hoes\nThey for everybody\nPass them all around, they at every party\nThey ain't gon be loyal, not for anybody\nStill I love these hoes\nThese hoes They for everybody\nOh, that was your girl? Oops, I'm sorry\nDon't bring her around, this just too much money\nYeah I love these hoes\n\n\nStop cuffing my nigga, is you the police?\nIs you the police? Is you the police?\nWhy you cuffin' my nigga? Is you the police?\nIs you the police? Is you the police?\n\n\nThese hoes\nThey for everybody\nPass them all around, they at every party\nThey ain't gon be loyal, not for anybody\nStill I love these hoes\nThese hoes They for everybody\nOh, that was your girl? Oops, I'm sorry\nDon't bring her around, this just too much money\nYeah I love these hoes"

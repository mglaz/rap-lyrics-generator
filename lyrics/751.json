        "\nIt's been a long ride, but I made it here with love\nI made it here with love, love\nSaid I've been and up and down and I've been through it all\nTook a while to know my heart\nOh, yes, it has, yeah\nBefore a love like this, you go\nThrough the fire and valley lows\nBut if you just hold on\nPlease hold on 'cause love is strong, it'll save ya\nOh, please hold on, it'll save ya, save ya\n\n\nTruth can be the sweetest pain\nIt can mess up everything\nIt's the only way you know\nI'm payin' for it, I'm changin' for it\nOh, oh, and it hurts\nBut I'll make it work\n'Cause I'm no beginner\nI'm a winner, paid dues, I know my purpose\n\n\nThought they'd put my life on hold\nBut I knew somethin' they didn't know\nI know myself too much to ever fold\nDark clouds, I'm movin' past you\n\n\nOh, you gotta love yourself\nIf you really wanna be with someone else\nYou gotta feed yourself\nBefore you feed somebody else\nYou gotta stay open, and don't be foolish\n'Cause everybody don't mean you well\nYou gotta love yourself\nBefore you love somebody else\n\n\nYeah, gotta love yourself\nUh, you know what I'm sayin'?\n\n\nI decided not to use my color as a handicap\nHe a designer, artist, producer, and he rap\nNever found virtue from patience\nIn a dark room just pacin'\nPrecious time is just wastin'\nYou do not know what we facin'\nI cannot be complacent\nIn my job, be courageous\nAnother kid just got shot\nThey can't find the assailant\nMade it out of the basement\nMade it out of the underground\nFrom a time where you outta town\nThey might gun you down, blaow\nThere goes another round, blaow\nThere goes another round\nCame from this Chi and wow, look what the fuck they found\nA young legend, comin' to shut the summer down\nYou need to talk to me like you don't bring your mother 'round\n\n\nOh, you gotta love yourself, oh yeah\nIf you really wanna be with someone else\nYou gotta feed yourself\nBefore you feed somebody else\nYou gotta stay open, and don't be foolish\n'Cause everybody don't mean you well\nYou gotta love yourself\nYou gotta love yourself\nBefore you love somebody else\n\n\nI don't feel no ways tired\nCan't get restless in my soul\nHold your heart, the world is cold\nKeep singin', don't you stop prayin', woman\nYeah, it will come to pass\nDon't worry 'bout nothin'\nGod knows that you're worth it\nYou deserve it, can't nothin' else hurt you\n\n\nThought they'd put my life on hold\nBut I knew somethin' they didn't know\nI know myself too much to ever fold\nDark clouds are movin' past you\n\n\nOh, you gotta love yourself, oh yeah\nIf you really wanna be with someone else\nYou gotta feed yourself\nBefore you feed somebody else\nYou gotta stay open, and don't be foolish\n'Cause everybody don't mean you well\nYou gotta love yourself\nYou gotta love yourself\nBefore you love somebody else\nSomebody else"

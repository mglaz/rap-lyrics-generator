        "\n\n\nI guess maybe some little problems could arise\n(There are always a few)\nIf anything happened and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would really be bad\n(Devastating)\nBecause this is very good\n(And that would be good)\nThat would be good too, the idea is to combine this and that\n\n\nTryna keep it low\nKeep 'em all on that need to know\nTell everybody that we're just friends\nBut to be honest that platonic shit's for TV shows\nSame place, we're with different folks\nCase closed if they crack the code\nIs it me, or is you cold?\nCause the feelings you ain't showin' pokin' out your clothes\nGo put a sweater on or get a room\nForbidden fruit, swimmin' in your juice\nLot of ways I can get to you\nBut my train of thought is tryna get you out your ch-ch-choo\n\n\nStill we keep it low\nKeep 'em all on that need to know\nCould somebody tell somebody\nI'm somebody and I'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go\nWork\n\n\nI'm not tryna pressure you\nJust can't stop thinkin' 'bout you\nYou ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend\nI just wanna know your name\nAnd maybe some time, we can hook up\nWe can hang out, we can just chill\n\n\nTryna keep it low\nKeep 'em all on that need to know\nTell 'em all that we're just cool\nAs far as me and you, we got a simple code\nSpendin' nights, well that's optional\nNo telephones in the afternoon\nI know that overthinkin' only leads to subtweetin'\nEvery time your ass in the mood\nSharin' thoughts when we share a room\nThough we barely talk when we share a room\nIn the dark, still see your curves\nBody like what, swear to God you're a miracle\n\n\nStill we keep it low\nKeep 'em all on that need to know\nCould somebody tell somebody\nI'm somebody and I'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go\n\n\nI'm not tryna pressure you\nJust can't stop thinkin' 'bout you\nYou ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend\nI just wanna know your name\nAnd maybe some time, we can hook up\nWe can hang out, we can just chill\n\n\nI mean let's say, what if we did?\n(What if?)\nIs that like the end of the world or something?\n(Certainly not!)\nWhy shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?\n(I know!)\nI mean really, what is the big deal? We go in there, we're in there for a while and then we come back out here. It's not complicated\n(It's almost stupid if we didn't!)\nIt's moronic\n(Absurd!)\n\n\nI'm not tryna pressure you\nJust can't stop thinkin' 'bout you\nYou ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend\nI just wanna know your name\nAnd maybe some time, we can hook up\nWe can hang out, we can just chill"

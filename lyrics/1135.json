        "\nDangerous, dangerous\nThese niggas can't hang with us hang with us\nNigga we dangerous, dangerous\nMy nigga we\n\n\nI swear all my life I been around crips and bloods\nGrips and slugs, the trigger happiest thugs\nClaiming the slums, and all the hoods that they from\nToo much of the some, got it twisted up blinded in a rat race\nCash straight, the fake kill jake, the snakes too late\nMy eyes dilate, and I could tell them how he strafe\nComing at me sideways, get straighten up\nDon't deflate it up gimmie the bucks my cash wrinkling up\nLooking back in the days\nAmazed 'cause the lab rat done made it out the maze\nStill feel caged, enraged though\nUsed the underground railroad like a runaway slave\nBroke off the chains still runway fresh\nGot you on that mental plane with my project jet\nI'm two steps above that nimbus cloud\nMy limit is low, when I'm smoking on that loud\nFocus in the now, when the lotus is around\nIt's the Brooklyn sound, a pro found, Biggie would be proud about\nBut I don't need a vet to even shout me out\nPunchlines pack a Pacquiao they can't box me out\n\n\nBig up big up, it's a stick up stick up\nNiggas hit a nigga quick if he hiccup hiccup\nBig up big up, it's a stick up stick up\nNiggas hit a nigga quick if he hiccup hiccup\nTell me what them know bout the Badmon named Jozif\nWomen come around, I look em down like they don't know shit\nWord around the town is that they got the match explode it\n\n\nI'm a child of the city\nSon of the streets\nAnd it's just a pity\nThey not tough like we\nAnd things not look pretty\nWhen we got to eat\nThings get much deeper\nDeeper and deeper\n\n\nAnd I survive, thank the father\nFeel like I was raised by Clans One Order\nHad to keep calm and hold ma corner\nCause a stray gun shot if you cross the border\nPro Era teach them the pros and cons\nOf living in a city with a thousand dons\nA thousand ghetto youths with a thousand guns\nCold hearted killers with frozen lungs\nBut praise rastafari we wheel and come again\nKnow I Nyabinghi sit know we the drummer dem\nDem ammunition are tougher we power dem\nLightning and thunder a devour them\nPro Era teach them the pros and cons\nOriginal Chronixx and Joe Badmon\nNo King Selassie, we have the golden crown\nGet ready for the shift we are the chosen ones\n\nI'm a child of the city, city, oooh\n\n\nI'm a child of the city\nSon of the streets\nAnd it's just a pity\nThey not tough like we\nAnd things not look pretty\nWhen we got to eat\nThings get much deeper, oh no\nDeeper and deeper\n\nThe belly of the beast\nI'm a child of the city, city, oooh city\nBeen get real ugly\nI got to eat\nNow every man has to stand on his own two feet\nYou have to love you have to dove tougher than a concrete\nIt's them to you a white sheet oh dear"

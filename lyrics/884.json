        "\nI'm cheating, and I'm in love with who I'm cheating with\nAnd when I'm not cheating, everynight's an argument\nI know that's something that I really shouldn't do\nBut I want my cake and wanna eat it too, we both cheating\nI'm cheating, and I'm in love with who I'm cheating with\nAnd when I'm not cheating, everynight's an argument\nI know that's something that I really shouldn't do\nBut I want my cake and wanna eat it too, we both cheating\n\n\nI cheated, I cheated, we played this game that we both needed\nYou were undefeated, walked around so conceited\nTemporary love is what we pretended we needed\nOr were we really pretending, cuz now I can't believe it\nLook at how I fill this card up, we yelling that we leaving\nKnowing it'd would never last, it's only for a season\nThat you go back to her, and I'll go back to him\nWhen I think of how you do me, I start hating him (I hate you)\nI don't know why I'm there, and you don't know either\nMaybe just cuz it's convenient just to say that he's my nigga\nOr is it just convenient just to say that she ya bitch\nAnd when you doing her, you think of this (you think of this)\n\n\nI'm cheating, and I'm in love with who I'm cheating with\nAnd when I'm not cheating, everynight's an argument\nI know that's something that I really shouldn't do\nBut I want my cake and wanna eat it too, we both cheating\nI'm cheating, and I'm in love with who I'm cheating with\nAnd when I'm not cheating, everynight's an argument\nI know that's something that I really shouldn't do\nBut I want my cake and wanna eat it too, we both cheating\n\n\nEvery night is an argument when I'm not with you\nI got a guilty conscious cuz I know my nigga see you\nLate at night I'm not in the mood, I'm acting funny\nEvery conversation I'm talking rude, I'm acting funny\nWhen he be touching on me, I swear it's not the same\nI remember one time I called him your name\nI played it off though, but who's to really blame?\nWe're playing a deck of cards, it's a dirty game\nThe sad part about it is he a good nigga\nThe temptation got me turnt up forreal nigga\nI'm cheating, and I'm caught up in the mix\nTell me when you're with ya girl, do you think of this?\n\n\nI'm cheating, and I'm in love with who I'm cheating with\nAnd when I'm not cheating, everynight's an argument\nI know that's something that I really shouldn't do\nBut I want my cake and wanna eat it too, we both cheating\nI'm cheating, and I'm in love with who I'm cheating with\nAnd when I'm not cheating, everynight's an argument\nI know that's something that I really shouldn't do\nBut I want my cake and wanna eat it too, we both cheating\n\n\nI know that I'm wrong\nBut this temptation is taking over me\nI mean the way that it makes you feel\nI feel defeat\nHe's a really good dude and\nHe doesn't deserve to be hurt...\nBut I can't help myself\n\n\nI'm cheating, and I'm in love with who I'm cheating with\nAnd when I'm not cheating, everynight's an argument\nI know that's something that I really shouldn't do\nBut I want my cake and wanna eat it too, we both cheating"

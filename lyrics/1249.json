        "\nI don't think we can be friends\nI don't think that I can even pretend\nWe used to be such a hit\nNow it just feels like a swing and a miss\nYou used to think I'm the shit\nSometimes I wish you could meet me again\nI know you always believed in the kid\nAnd my music and that I'd succeed and go big\nAnd subsequently I'll be bringing you with\nWe would get married, and we would be rich\nEverything changed, I wasn't the same\nNow you think that you believed in a myth\nI cannot tell you the reason for this\nSummer is coming I'm facing temptations\nMaybe I'm selfish and I think with my dick\nRemember we spent all of those nights in my basement\n\n\nI know that I'm really all that you want\nWish you could say \"this is all that I need\"\nI know you see right through all of my fronts\nI don't know who I've been trying to be\nI do not think that's a problem with us\nI just think that is a problem with me, me, me\nI don't know when she can stand anymore\nI don't know when she can stand anymore\nShe doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no\nShe doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no no\nNo no, no no\nNo no\nNo no, no no\n\n\nI'm sorry we're not what you thought we could be\nBut it's not what you think\nThis is way worse than I thought it would be\nI know that I'm not what I promised to be\nI promised myself I'd be honest with you and I wanted to do this shit honorably\nI know that you've always been honest with me\nCan't help but think that I took you for granted\nCause if there's a problem then it's gotta be me\nI guess I was never prepared for the truth\nTelling myself the decision was right\nAnd to have no regrets cause I'm scared that I do\n\n\nOhhhhhhhh\nYou got me thinking like\nYou got me thinking like\nYou got me thinking like\nOhhhhhhhh\nYou got me thinking like\nYou got me thinking like\nYou got me thinking like\n\n\nYeah, and now we just stuck in the grayest of areas\nThinking back to when I'd say I would marry you\nThinking back to all of them days I would stare at you\nThinking back when you would be drunk at a party\nAnd I was right there I be taking good care of you\nI still remember the first time I saw you\nAnd I do not think there was a way of preparing us\nFor the inevitable, that's how it seems\nWhen you go to college and I chase a dream\nEventually you'll find a man of integrity\nSomeone that's better you think I could never be, uh\nProlly a guy with some muscles\nThe type that be smoking and drinking that liquor\nProlly a guy with a beard, prolly a fella who's penis is bigger\n\n\nI gotta get myself focused again\nSometimes it feels like you're all that I know\nI know you think we should only be friends\nCause it might just help us to soften the blow\nBut I don't think that I can even pretend\nI do not think that I'll have that control\nI don't know when she can stand anymore\nI don't know when she can stand anymore\nShe doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no\nShe doesn't think I'm the man anymore, no no\nNo no, no no\nNo no\nNo no, no no\n\n\nI'm sorry we're not what you thought we could be\nBut it's not what you think\nThis is way worse than I thought it would be\nI know that I'm not what I promised to be\nI promised myself I'd be honest with you and I wanted to do this shit honorably\nI know that you've always been honest with me\nCan't help but think that I took you for granted\nCause if there's a problem then it's gotta be me\nI guess I was never prepared for the truth\nTelling myself the decision was right\nAnd to have no regrets cause I'm scared that I do\n\n\nOhhhhhhhh\nYou got me thinking like\nYou got me thinking like\nYou got me thinking like\nOhhhhhhhh\nYou got me thinking like\nYou got me thinking like\nYou got me thinking like"

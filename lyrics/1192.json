        "\nShawty badder than a three-year-old\nKeep playing and I'ma eat her like a pita roll\nI'm just saying, with my love I could feed her soul\nTwo-day getaway and we don't need our clothes\nWe at the pool and she looking like a center fold\nTwo tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo\nShe got Indian in her family, Seminole\nMe and shawty go together like chemicals\nAnd she get mad when I call other women hoes\nYou send her rose, I pick some flowers and send her those\nTall glass of Merlot get her in the mode\nTwo tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe\nI whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe\nAnd when she check her watch, it\u2019s never time to go\nAnd with her brain she should make the honor roll\nAnd when I came she caught me like a common cold\n\n\nDamn you the shit\nAnd I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit\nAnd I don't really know how to handle this shit\nBut tonight its moonlight and candles and shit\n\n\nWith you baby\nWith you baby\nWith you baby\nWith you baby\nWith you and only you\n\n\nI say damn I must be left\n'Cause you the best I ever seen, right\nShawty put me on, you got me going like some green lights\nSee you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right\nBet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice\nLet's get together over night\nShawty I'm a pro and you are looking like the prototype\nMs. Cita, I took your advice\nSometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice\nI'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger\nAppetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger\nI be on that lavender\nI be in the bath with her\nThen I gotta go under that water like a mariner\n\n\nDamn you the shit\nAnd I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit\nAnd I don't really know how to handle this shit\nBut tonight its moonlight and candles and shit\n\n\nWith you baby\nWith you baby\nWith you baby\nWith you baby\nWith you and only you\n\n\nNow she don't know about me but I'ma put her on it\nAnd she ain't sure about me but can't go without me\nWe probably ain't supposed to be together\nBut I wonder if our love affair could last forever\nAnd shawty I'm with you\nSmoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you\nThen I told her to her face\nIf everyone was like you, the world would be a better place\n\n\nDamn you the shit\nAnd I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit\nAnd I don't really know how to handle this shit\nBut tonight its moonlight and candles and shit\n\n\nWith you baby\nWith you baby\nWith you baby\nWith you baby\nWith you and only you\n\n\nDamn you the shit\nAnd I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit\nAnd I don't really know how to handle this shit\nBut tonight\n\n\nWith you baby\nWith you baby\nWith you baby\nWith you baby\nWith you and only you"

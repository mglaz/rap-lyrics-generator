        "\nCan you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know\nGirl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow\nYou just put your lips together and you come real close\nCan you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go\n\n\nLook, I'm bettin' you like people\nAnd I'm bettin' you love freak mode\nAnd I'm bettin' you like girls\nThat give love to girls and stroke your little ego\nI bet you I'm guilty, your honor\nThat's just how we live in my genre\nWho in the hell done paved the road wider?\nThere's only one Flo and one Rida\nI'm a damn shame, order more champagne\nPulling them hamstrings, tryna put it on ya\nBet your lips spin back around corner\nSlow it down, baby, take a little longer\n\n\nCan you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know\nGirl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow\nYou just put your lips together and you come real close\nCan you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go\n\n\nWhistle, baby, whistle, baby\nWhist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby\nWhistle, baby, whistle, baby\nWhist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby\n\n\nIt's like everywhere I go, my whistle ready to blow\nShawty don't even know, she can get any for the low\nTold me she's not a pro, it's okay, it's under control\nShow me soprano 'cause, girl, you can handle\nBaby, we'll start slow then you come up and park close\nGirl, I'm the whistle man, my Bugatti the same notes\nShow me your perfect pitch, you got it, my banjo\nTalented with your lips like you blew out a candle\nSo amusing\nNow you can make a whistle with the music\nHope you ain't got no issues, you can do it\nEven if it's no picture, never lose it\n\n\nCan you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know\nGirl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow\nYou just put your lips together and you come real close\nCan you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go\n\n\nWhistle, baby, whistle, baby\nWhist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby\nWhistle, baby, whistle, baby\nWhist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby\n\n\nGo on, girl, you can twerk it\nLet me see your whistle while you work it\nI'ma lay it back, don't stop it\n'Cause I love it how you drop it, drop it, drop it on me\nNow, shorty, let that whistle blow-ow-ow-ow\nYeah, baby, let that whistle blow-ow-ow\n\n\nCan you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know\nGirl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow\nYou just put your lips together and you come real close\nCan you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go\n\n\nCan you blow my whistle, baby?\nWhistle, baby, whistle, baby\nCan you blow my whistle, baby?\nWhist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby\nCan you blow my whistle, baby?\nWhistle, baby, whistle, baby\nCan you blow my whistle, baby?\nWhist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby"

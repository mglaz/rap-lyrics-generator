        "\nDeadly rhymes the pages of rage strikes again\nKilling men, women and children\nTil defeat, types of shelter, helter skelter\nNobody's around here to help ya\n\n\nUp in flames, the brainstorm rain drains your veins\nThe only remains is rains of brains\nFixed to mix, Shante's lyrics cause conflicts\nI'm bookin' my rhymes like convicts\n\n\nGod prayed for a death wish? Come on, step up\nSome tried to keep up, but never kept up\nWhen I roll, nobody can't hold me\nSo they all told me to make 'em die slowly\n\n\nThe warning signs of danger read \"please take precautions\"\nI'm giving your baby rhymes abortions\nHit the deck when I wreck, one got shot in the neck\nPoison escaped through the tape decks\nConfusion, havin' a need for a blood transfusion\nShe couldn't stop my intrusion\n\n\nYou're in the path of a lyrical tidal wave\nSound waves take you straight to your graves\nPain remains in your head, suffocation\nStrangulation, wipe out a whole nation\n\n\nOn stage tryin' to recite like me\nBut what I really see is Creepshow 3\nI size em up to die and pulverize 'em\nSo bad, her own mother won't recognize her\n\n\nThis goes for those, that oppose like foes\nBut I don't diss (I dispose)\nSomewhere right near nightmare right where you might hear\nSongs are long like light years\n\n\nSo here's a taste of the lyrical greats of all time\nWHAT? Deadly rhymes\n\n*Chorus*\n\n\nAttack, ready to track the wack rappers who slack\nI attract, cause you lack, you sad sack\nThe microphone fanatic comin' in with the impact\nIn fact this track, to subtract, I pack\nA pile of stacks back in the sack for snacks\nBut I react, right and exact, cause I'm black\nGot a taste, and treble and bass you can't chase\nIn case you wanna race the pace I got haste\nTo ace in your case, in your face just like mace\nI replace, wreck the place and then erase, sho'!\n\n\nI captivated, those that violated\nAlienated, styles annihilated\nRappers, evacuated, faded, vacated\nWaited, for my spot to be isolated\nCrash and smash and bash you in the trash\nIn a flash, I whiplash you burned to an ash\nA mass defeat, delete, rhymes are like concrete\nRap athletes all retreat to my beat\nExcept they don't step with pep, they get carried in a stretcher\nDone by the treacherous rap wrecker\n\n\nStart tearin' and scarin', what you're hearin'\nWill put fear in, so I'm comparin'\nYou get tossed across like Kris Kross\nTo force, you fell of course, boss (so now you're lost)\nAll rhymes are organized like crime\nThat's why I titled this here design\nDEADLY RHYMES"

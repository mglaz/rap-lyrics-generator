        "\nYou can get anything you want\nKnow what I'm saying?\nYou want that over there?\nYou want that over there?\nI got you\n\n\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\n\n\nI was up late night balling\nSo far from my past misfortune\nNo sleepin', late nights no eatin'\nGun squeezing, I'm a real Artesian\nRamona, I was round that corner\nStill down, I'm a Norf Norf soldier\nG slide right down do Sawyer\nWhen we slide, you won't see morning\nAnother story of a young black man\nTryna make it up out that jam, god damn\nBag back, let me make my bands, got plans\nIf you hatin' don't shake my hand\nTake it easy, homie\nReminiscin' sitting in that Benz\nOf the 22 bus stop way back when\nWith the 22, 5 shot eyes on scan\nFor the click, clack, clap\nOr the boop, bop, bam, cuz\n\n\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\n\n\nIt's funny I was going crazy not too long ago\nWomen problems every morning like the Maury show\nSwimming upstream while I'm tryna keep my bread\nFrom the sharks make me wanna put the hammer to my head\nAt the park politickin' with the kids\nTryna get em on a straight path, got the lames mad\nKnow they hate to see me make cash, got the space dash\nIn the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house\nCompensation conversations what I'm all about\nTook the smart route, never been marked out\nShoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out\nBut it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking\nQuarterbackin' like I'm 40 Water\nMix the holy water with the Voss\nWanna be the boss then you gotta pay the cost\nLearned it from the Dogg I'm from Long Beach\nThat's the city where the skinny carry strong heat\n\n\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand\nI was up late night ballin'\nCountin' up hundreds by the thousand"

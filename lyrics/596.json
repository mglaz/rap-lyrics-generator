        "\nReminiscin-in' on our time of innocence\nWhen we drank that Hennessy, ate on lamb and venison\nFace fucked you in your kitchenette, fucked you like we tusslin'\nDo you fuck your husb-al-and? Like, do y'all be tusslin'?\nDo you wear the muzzlin'? Do you ask him \"Pretty please?\"\nDo you crawl on hands and knees, like you used to do for me\nOh, you such a dirty girl, the world won't let you be yourself\nI won't accept nothing else, I be having none of that\nYou be takin' all of this, pleasure come from punishment\nYour threshold astonishin', I think I'm in love again\nFound my perfect drug again, feel better than heroin\nYou love my alpha arrogance, 2 Live Crew the narrative\nAnd there it is\n\n\nI put that dick in her mouth all day\nShe got that (dick in her mouth all day)\nShe take that (dick in her mouth all day)\n(She said she wanted my, wanted my)\nDick in her mouth all day, day\nI give her that (dick in her mouth all day)\nShe play with that (dick in her mouth all day)\nShe want that (dick in her mouth all day)\nI think I'm in love again (Love again)\n\n\nHere I am, my love, just like when we first hooked up\nFeeling like I'm animal, feeling like you're edible, bendable\nI been away, I don't have too much to say\nYou say, \"Say it anyway\"\nI say, \"Take your shit off, I'm not playing, bae\"\nYou little freak, what you are is so unique\nSmart and full of filth and joy\nYou been with some little boys\nNow you're with a grown-up man\nOne who'll actually understands\nKid gloves are not on my hands\nI will never condescend, now spread yourself\nShe smiled a bit, gripped the outline of my shit\nOh, my god, I love this chick, I must put my tongue in this\nInto every space I go, give me everything you am\nShe said, \"No, you gimme first\"\nThat was like a day ago, 8 a.m\nShe still got my\n\n\nDick in her mouth all day\nShe got that (dick in her mouth all day)\nShe take that (dick in her mouth all day)\n(She said she wanted my, wanted my)\nDick in her mouth all day, day\nI give her that (dick in her mouth all day)\nShe play with that (dick in her mouth all day)\nShe want that (dick in her mouth all day)\nI think I'm in love again (Love again)\n\n\nThat's what you want, huh?\nWell, let me tell you a little story\nI had a young player from the hood, lick my pussy real good\nKept me stuck with lots of wood\nKept my bank account on swoll\nSniffed my pussy like a rose, smokin' on dro\nMade a porn tape, that nigga is a pro, you ain't know?\nHe had a lot of bad bitches in his past\nBut I was the one who turned that boy into a motherfuckin' man\nHis tongue is bomb, and he love for me to ride his face\nFront to back, grippin' ass\nPay my bills, where I live, fuck me good\nBroke ass niggas killing me, I'm about my money, ho\nNever been a square bitch, he ain't paying? Hit the fuckin' door\nTalking slick, that Memphis shit, I be from that Haven clique\nKeep it ratchet, so sweet, all these boys kiss my feet\nI be on that queen shit, you better bless my realness\nStick your tongue up in my ass\nYou better show me who you fuckin' with\nRun The Jewels, love again, you gon' lose, I'm gon' win\nLet's have an orgy, I'mma share your ass with all my friends\n(Yeah, ho!)\n\n\nHe want this clit in his mouth all day\nHe want this clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)\nI put my clit in his mouth all day\nI've got this I've got this fool in love again (Yeah, ho!)\nI put my clit in his mouth all day\nI put my clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)\nHe want this clit in his mouth all day\nI've got this fool in love again (Love again)\nIn love again"

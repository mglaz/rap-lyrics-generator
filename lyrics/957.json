        "\n\n\nWhen I get down on my luck I hide behind my eyes in Hollywood\nThey say ain't what you know but who you know\nYou need to know someone to know no one\nWhen I get down on my luck\nI roll one up and roll around all by my lonesome\nLost some years, I used to know\nI know my fate like bullets in a shotgun\n\n\nWhen I get down on my luck I hide behind my eyes in Hollywood\nThey say ain't what you know but who you know\nYou need to know someone to know no one\nWhen I get down on my luck\nI roll one up and roll around all by my lonesome\nLost some years, I used to know\nI know my fate like bullets in a shotgun\n\n\nShe loves to dream, living in and off and out her mind\nIn space and time, she takes a line & lies her life\nAway you might just say she stays to go nowhere\nMidnight scenes from an old romantic movie\nUsually you'd be there today I say was different\nI can take you with me wondering, if you wanna go there\nDown on my luck\nDown on my luck\n\n\nDo you think about the things you say you don't?\nI know you do, white wine she over cool\nOoh look at you, look at you\nDo you think the things you do or who you know?\nCause they told you to, why you listen to 'em?\nHands up, middle finger to 'em\nFuck that, get down\n\n\nWhen I get down on my luck I hide behind my eyes in Hollywood\nThey say ain't what you know but who you know\nYou need to know someone to know no one\nWhen I get down on my luck\nI roll one up and roll around all by my lonesome\nLost some years, I used to know\nI know my fate like bullets in a shotgun\n\nWhen I get down on my luck, when I get down on my luck\nWhen I get down on my luck, when I get down on my luck\nDown on my luck, down on my luck\n\n\nDo you think about the things you say you don't?\nI know you do, white wine she over cool\nOoh look at you, look at you\nDo you think the things you do or who you know?\nCause they told you to, why you listen to 'em?\nHands up, middle finger to 'em\nFuck that, get down"

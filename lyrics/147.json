        "\nDon't know why thinking of him makes me smile...\n\n\nSaid, you just don't know how beautiful you are\nAnd baby that's my favorite part\nYou walk around so clueless to it all\nLike nobody gonna break your heart\nIt'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered\nI'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one\nIf it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry\nWe ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love\n\n\nSaid, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie\nSaid, the universe couldn't keep us apart\nWhy would it even try?\nYeah, said, don't let them hurt you ever\nI know you far too smart\nBefore things come together, they have to fall apart\nIt's been a while since I've been sober\nThis life can be so hard, I'd rather talk about you\n\n\nSaid, you just don't know how beautiful you are\nAnd baby that's my favorite part\nYou walk around so clueless to it all\nLike nobody gonna break your heart\nIt'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered\nI'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one\nIf it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry\nWe ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love\n\n\nIf you wanna stay, we're taking it slow baby\nCause you and me, and I got enough on my mind\nBut I can make some time for something so divine\n\n\nSaid, you just don't know how beautiful you are\nAnd baby that's my favorite part\nYou walk around so clueless to it all\nLike nobody gonna break your heart\nIt'll be alright babe, see, me, I got you covered\nI'm gon' be your lover, you might be the one\nIf it's only tonight, ayy, we don't need to worry\nWe ain't in a hurry, rushin' into love"

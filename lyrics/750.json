Who you wanna be huggin?\nDippin on ya Ninja Honda with Tanisha and Rhonda, wha!\nYou work more body than Jane Fonda\nPhysical fitness, Mary Blige be my witness\nUnder pressure, I lie for ya, die for ya\nRuger by the thigh for you, right hand high for ya\nBecause of you, I'm inheritin' trillions\nBuryin' billions, Bentley Coupe millions\nPlayin' good samaritan, in the Sheridan\nCrack the Dom P's and Remy's, you better hurry in\nWho's gone love you like I do? Huh? Wha?\nWho's gone treat you like I do? Huh? Wha?\nMary Blige, Lil Kim, hah-hah\nQueen Bees, ah-hah, that's me\nThat's right, Mary J, Lil K\n\n\nI can love you (I can), I can love you (love you)\nI can love you better than she can\nI can love you (I can love you), I can love you (I can love you)\nI can love you better than she can\nI can love you (I can), I can love you (love you)\nI can love you better than she can\nI can love you (I can love you), I can love you (I can love you)\nI can love you better than she can\n\n\nWho's gonna make you feel the way I do?\nNobody, nobody\nWho's gonna make you feel the way I do?\nNobody, nobody"

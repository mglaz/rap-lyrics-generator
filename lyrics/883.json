        "\nI'm tired of all the happy men who rule the world\nThey grow\u2014of that I'm sure\nThey grow\u2014but don't mature\nI'd like the chance to hide in that world\n\nI'm listening\nTo these men who aren't quite men yet\nBut aren't boys\nMake noise\nAnd throw their knives;\nTheir toys are people's lives\nThey fight too hard\nAnd play too rough\nThey sometimes love, but not enough\nMy heart will beat at will, but still\n\nIt's crazy how they're acting\nIt's crazy my response\nIt's stupid how I love them\nSo dumb, how I anticipate their wants\nBut as long as they amuse me\nThat alone is what's required\n\nSo I'll roar\nLike I'm wired\nI'll explore what I'm feeling\nExcept what I'm feeling is tired\nI'm tired\n\nSo tired of all the happy men who rule the world\nHappy, frightened men who rule the world\nStupid, charming men\nSilly, childish jerks\n\nThat said, I'll be his wife\nI'll wed and change my life\nI'll laugh, I'll smile, I'll welcome cheer\nThe time is right, the men are near\nNow happiness and love appear"

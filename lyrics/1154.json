        "\nAy ay, gang gang gang!\n\n\nBitch I'm on the block, I got my tool on me\nCause I got all this money, and this jewelry on me\nMy mob is no bitch, ain't no fool in me\nAnd if you talking to the cops, you ain't cool with me\nThis hoe wanna be my wife, but I ain't cuffing shit\nTell that bitch eat eat, she can suck a dick\nAnd tell that fuckboy talking shit, he can eat a clip\nAll them guns on IG, but he ain't bout shit\n\nFuck all the Twitter beef, I don't sneak diss\nI'll show up at on his porch with that .45\nHave him running out the back like a lil bitch\nShooting in the window, now his bro hit\nIf you hanging with the opps, you an opp too\nAnd when shots get fired, you get shot too\nHaters wanna sneak diss, 'til we come through\nRun up on his ass, show him what that mob do\n\nI keep my nine tucked right behind that Fendi\nAnd all I really want is them blue Benjies\nOn the block, all day, and I'm drinking Henny\nAnd if a goofey want smoke, then we got plenty\nReaching for my chain, shoot him in his neck\nBig 30, in this 40, make him  two step\nYelling \"Fuck you, and your gang\", you don't get respect\nMade me call a Killa Cam, hit you with that Tech\nAnd if you scared to catch a case, you can't hang with us\nBang with us, gang with us, got them thangs with us\nIf the opps pull up, we'll rearrange in them\nFully loaded .30 clips, and we bang in them\n\nI know the rules of the game, I can't cuff a thot\nI hit the box two times, 'til it kick rocks\nPass her ass to the gang, and I hit the block\n'Til I got a couple bands tucked in my rocks\nReal savages, I'm still with my day-ones\nIn the same streets, where they tote guns\nGotta keep a strap, can't come without one\nIf he catch me lacking, stomp him in my A1's\nRun up on us wrong, and we up in Glocks\nKnock your head off your shoulders with that red dot\nGun shot, gun shot, now the block hot\nBut we still outside, yelling \"Fuck the cops\"\n\n\nGang gang gang, y'all know what the fuck we coming\nAin't shit sweet\nRun up on the gang, you going to sleep in the street, bitch"

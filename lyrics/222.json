They be mentioning me\nToo hot, I be molesting the beat, fuck math\nTeachers should teach us to get Smith & Wesson\u2019s off of the street\nSo first class be a lesson for me\nFuck what you teaching for some regents, I'm flying over regions\nReaching, all time highs where Jesus can\u2019t reach us\nCensor me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace\nThis is for my niggas, killers, hundred dollar billers\nOn the block in the rock spot, Glock cocked watching out for cops\nAll about their cheddar, young guns know nothing that\u2019s better\nLike fuck a prison letter, those Beretta\u2019s led us to the lettuce\nRelish fetishes, menaces want the senator\u2019s percentages\nIf you ain't prejudice you still a nemesis\nSmoking on the Clematis, get open like a present is\nNow your presence is on the premises for them presidents\nMy city be the genesis for where they think the terror is\nThey linking terrorists from the Stuy to Lincoln Terraces\nStay on that reckless shit, they leave you left for the dead\nKids don\u2019t play they\u2019ll erase your head in a race for the bread\nChildren on the corners slinging some regs, popping some meds\nJakes be so deep in cover they be chasing the feds\nI be back stage gripping haze breaking my leg\nMy folks was making the best when they was naked in bed, muthafucka\n\n\nOne day I'm tryna have a wife and kids\nSo I just can't live my life like this\nAnd I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is\nSo I just can't live my life like this\nI want the gold chains and diamond rings\nBut I just can't live my life like this\nAnd sometimes I just wanna light this spliff\nBut I just can't live my life like this"

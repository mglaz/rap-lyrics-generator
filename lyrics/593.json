        "\nWe return from the depths of the badlands\nWith a gun and a knife in our waistband\nWent to war with the Devil and Shaytan\nHe wore a bad toupee and a spray tan\nSo high now, hoping that I land\nOn a Thai stick, moving through Thailand\nOn the radio, heard a plane hijack\nGovernment did that like they cooked crack\nI move in a world of conspiracies\nObey no rules, I'm doing me\nSmoke kush, transport to the airport\nCustoms found a joint in my passport\nPulled cash and I gave him what he asked for\nGoddammit, it's a motherfucking miracle\nSmall bribe, made it back into America\nHit Uber and maneuvered out the area\nRhyme animal, pit bull terrier\nRap terrorist, terrorize, tear it up\nBrought gas and the matches to flare it up\nMilitant Michael might go psycho\nOn any ally or rival\nBorn Black, that's dead on arrival\nMy job is to fight for survival\nIn spite of these #AllLivesMatter-ass white folk\n\n\nThis is spiritual warfare that you have been dealing with. This is not a fight that you have been dealing with flesh and blood but this is a fight against principalities and evil doers and unclean spirits\n(RTJ3 motherfuckers)\n\n\nBrave men didn't die face down in the Vietnam muck so I could not style on you\nI didn't walk uphill both ways to the booth and back to not wile on you\nYou think baby Jesus killed Hitler just so I'd whisper?\nAnd you're safe and sound and these crooks tapped your phone to not have a file on you?\nWhat, me worry? Nah, buddy, I've lost before, so what?\nYou don't get it, I'm dirt, motherfucker, I can't be crushed\nFuckers, open the books up and stop bullshitting the kid\nMy dick got a Michelin star, I'm on par with the best ever took the gig\nI'm a super cat, from don dada to dusk, don't bother to touch\nI got firm clutch on the grip and the bucks\nI might ghost ride a tank, take a ride to the bank\nI'm the son of Rick Rubin rushing full-thrust\nDon't flash weak shit to the Shark Tank judge\nTalk real good 'cause I'm smart and stuff\nWe a good crew to fuck with, better to love\n\n\nI told y'all suckers, I told y'all suckers. I told y'all on RTJ1, then I told ya again on RTJ2, and you still ain't believe me. So here we go, RTJ3\n\n\nTalk to me\n(RTJ)\nTalk to me"

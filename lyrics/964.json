        " (Making the Beat)\n\n\n\n\nTo get you what you need\nMake you love it, make you want it\nCause baby you are so amazing\nTo get you what you need\nMake you love it, make you want it\nCause baby you are so amazing\nTo get you what you need\nMake you love it, make you want it\nCause baby you are so amazing\n\n\nPack the bong, pack the bong, pack the bong, pack it\nI'm Pacquiao on the track, flow the tempo you should tap it\nTap out or blackout, black is beautiful say yes indeed\nLeave my demons in the dust, conducting electricity\nI'm Silkk the Shocker with a fifth of vodka\nBag of drugs in my knickerbockers\nBach on the staff sheet, trying to pen an opera\nSounds so beautiful\nFogging my bifocals window shopping at the Gucci store\nKnow when you want it, but just can't have it\nEspecially as an artist, don't that shit make you mad\nJust breathe, breathe, breathe, it's all in your head\nKnow these labels wanna sign me for an arm and a leg\nCut my publishing in half like I have to fold (Origami)\nFor a dollar, what's a half of a half a whole\nQuarter water or Courvoisier\nComplicate things when money's what you conversate\nBut this is just so that you know\n\n\nTo get you what you need\nMake you love it, make you want it\nCause baby you are so amazing\nTo get you what you need\nMake you love it, make you want it\nCause baby you are so amazing\nTo get you what you need\nMake you love it, make you want it\nCause baby you are so amazing\n\n\nHold up, hold up, hold up, yo wait up, wait up, I'ma let you finish\nBut finna be famous one day just really ain't where I fit in\nFell in love when I was fifteen, I guess you could call it tennis\nMy tendency for this music is so much deeper than business\nI build a beat in the morning, record it before the evening\nWhy is it what seems important seems always to be misleading\nI wish I could see the future, just wish I could see the future\nTell me everything be okay just like my momma used to\nMy youths unfolding before me, be twenty before I know it\nI'm trying to write my Illmatic, get TVs that's panoramic\nWas riding around in a rental and I don't mean it was rented\nTotalled my momma's Prius, I vaguely remember spinning\nI fell asleep from the studio\nMust've been saved cause no one hit me\nThey made a list about Chicago rappers and they skipped me\nMaybe because I'm so much more\nForget what you not, this is about what you are\n\n\nTo get you what you need\nMake you love it, make you want it\nCause baby you are so amazing\nTo get you what you need\nMake you love it, make you want it\nCause baby you are so amazing\nTo get you what you need\nMake you love it, make you want it\nCause baby you are so amazing"

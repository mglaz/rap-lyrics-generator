        "\nWalk a mile in these Louboutins\nBut they don't wear these shits where I'm from\nI'm not hating, I'm just telling you\nI'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through\n\n\nTwo feet in the red dirt, school skirt\nSugar cane, back lanes\nThree jobs, took years to save\nBut I got a ticket on that plane\nPeople got a lot to say\nBut don't know shit about where I was made\nOr how many floors that I had to scrub\nJust to make it past where I am from\n\n\nNo money, no family\n16 in the middle of Miami\nNo money, no family\n16 in the middle of Miami\nNo money, no family\n16 in the middle of Miami\n16 in the middle of Miami\n\n\nI've been up all night, tryna get that rich\nI've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit\nMilked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live\nI've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nWorkin' on my shit\n\n\nYou can hate it or love it\nHustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting\nThoroughbred in a mud brick before the budget\nWhite chick on that Pac shit\nMy passion was ironic\nAnd my dreams were uncommon\nGuess I gone crazy, first deal changed me\nRobbed blind, basically raped me\nRose through the bullshit like a matador\nJust made me madder and adamant to go at 'em\nAnd even the score\nSo, I went harder\nStudied the Carters till a deal was offered\nSlept cold on the floor recording\nAt four in the morning\nAnd now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer\nImmigrant, art ignorant\nYa ill intent was insurance for my benefit\nHate to be inconsiderate\nBut the industry took my innocence\nToo late, now I'm in this bitch!\n\nYou don't know the half\nThis shit get real\nValley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins\nWhat you call that?\nHead over heels\n\n\nNo money, no family\n16 in the middle of Miami\nNo money, no family\n16 in the middle of Miami\nNo money, no family\n16 in the middle of Miami\n16 in the middle of Miami\n\n\nI've been up all night, tryna get that rich\nI've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit\nMilked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live\nI've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nWorkin' on my shit\n\n\nPledge allegiance to the struggle\nAin't been easy\nBut cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffle\nBags is all we had\nDo anything for my Mama, I love you\nOne day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice\nThat ya managed to muscle\nSixteen, you sent me through customs so\nAll aboard my spaceship to Mercury\nTurn first at the light that's in front me\n'Cause every night I'ma do it like it's my last\nThis dream is all that I need\n'Cause it's all that I ever had\n\n\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nWorkin' on my shit\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nNow get this work\nWorkin' on my shit"

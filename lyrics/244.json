Kelly\nR.I.P. Lil Snupe, give that boy his life back\nTake Eric Holder, give us Eric Wright back\nI'm sending you this message, Lord, I hope you hit me right back\nThey say I'm on the wrong train, I know I'm on the right track (Yeah)\n'Cause Trayvon gone, and all he did was try to fight back\nZimmerman walk around free, we don't like that (We don't like that)\nWhy you take our mothers from us?\nOur fathers and our sisters and our cousins from us?\nGot these children getting murdered while they double dutchin'\nWonder why the fuck you take Nipsey Hussle from us?\nDamn, you took a true king, a true brother from us\nThis a fuckin' marathon, but they runnin' from us\nNow everybody got guns, niggas up to something\nAnd every gangsta wanna prove that they tough or something\nYou know it's not fair, tell the truth, I've been in my feelings too\nBut if you took Emmett Till, at least take Dylann Roof\nAt least take James Holmes, I ain't even mad at that\nJust bring back Whitney, and give us Michael Jackson back\nFeds want me in the slammer, damn\nAin't no justice for Sandra Bland, we up like the ceiling fan\nLord, if you listenin', I'm just lookin' for a hand to hand\nTake out the fuck niggas and give us back our fam again\nDrownin' in my tears, tryna pray for something (Woo!)\nWonder why you give us life for you to take it from us (Woo!)\nWonder why you give us family then erase them from us (Woo!)\nMaybe hopefully you can have a conversation with us (Yeah)\nMaybe I'm just probably tripping 'cause I need a hug (I need a hug)\nThe hood can't find jobs, now we need a plug (We need a plug)\nEverybody and their mama tryna be a thug\nI don't go to church 'cause I'm afraid of being judged\nI've been starin' at the ceiling as I lie in bed\nWatchin' niggas follow trends like Simon Says (Yeah)\nI pray you give us back the real ones and try again\nOr maybe take them niggas that deserve to die instead\nTomi Lahren run her mouth and then she get defensive\nLaura Ingraham laughin' at death and disrespectin'\nI really feel like you should teach them stupid hoes a lesson\nEither that or give us back somebody who deserve the blessings\nI left out a bunch of names that I forgot to mention\nCost too much to pay attention, then it got expensive\nFather forgive me, for I know not what I do\nAnd now I'm reachin' out to you, hopin' you hear me and return the message (Joyner)\nI know that you got our back and that you're not against us\nOr maybe you just love us so you doin' shit to test us\nI just kinda thought that you would do more to protect us\nThey say that the good die young and I ain't on the guest list\nI've been drinkin', Lord forgive me, it's my blood racin'\nI don't know what I'm thinking, I'm just frustrated\nI don't mean to question you, I'm just confused\nI don't know what else to do, I've been patient and it sucks waiting\nTook my mans from me, that forever hurts\nBut puttin' the blame on you, that'd never work\nI know this ain't your fault, it's the devil's work\nDevil's work"

        "\nNiggas fighting over rings\nNiggas wanna be the King, but\nLong Live the Chief\nFor a li' ol' thang lil' boys bang bang\nLong Live the Chief\nNiggas fighting over rings\nNiggas wanna be the king, but\nLong Live the Chief\nYeah watch pretty mama while I slang my cane\nLong Live the Chief\nUh\n\n\nCockroaches and the rat shit\nHand me downs with the patches\nMama put a little money in the mattress\nTaught me how to make a silver spoon out of plastic\nYou can either sink, swim or be the captain\nGet the last word I'mma get the last laugh in\nNow they say \"Jidenna why you dressing so classic?\"\nI don\u2019t want my best dressed day in a casket\nYou can either lead, follow or get out the way\nMake a fuckin' move it would make my fuckin' day\nGot a 100 year plan you jus' think about today\nAlways been about time more than been about pay\nCan't rump with me\nUsain couldn\u2019t run with me\nChief come to find you\nYou don\u2019t come for me\nAt best you can run a lil' company\nNigga at worst, I could run the whole country\nThat's right - pimp game like a brothel\u00a0\nThat's why - I don\u2019t judge a nigga's hustle\u00a0\nI Airbnb the crib like a hostel\u00a0\nSummer rate cheaper 'cause the streets get hostile\nShaka boy, this fire from Mojave boy\nSo no I won\u2019t record for your homie boy\u00a0\nI turn the party out like a naughty toy\nThen I go and hide in plain sight like a lobby boy\nYessuh, that's Jidenna on the banner\nRidin' for my niggas gettin' locked up in the slammer\nElders saying everything's a nail to a hammer\nAnd niggas can\u2019t spell but we know our Instagrammar\nWell done's better than well said\nI read niggas well, a nigga well read\nReally I ain't met nobody smarter\nThat's why I got admitted but I still rejected Harvard\nI\u2019m the fresh prince, in a school where they couldn\u2019t read\nMama put me in a school with the Kennedys\nWhen I met Bill Clinton I was seventeen\nBut dead presidents is all my niggas need\nDining with the governor's daughter\nAnd her father say I remind him of Obama\nI\u2019m the chief diplomat...every day\nAnd I\u2019m black and white...Janelle Monae\n\n\nNiggas fighting over rings\nNiggas wanna be the King, but\nLong Live the Chief\nFor a li' ol' thang lil' boys bang bang\nLong Live the Chief\nNiggas fighting over rings\nNiggas wanna be the king, but\nLong Live the Chief\nNow watch pretty mama while I slang my cane\nLong Live the Chief"

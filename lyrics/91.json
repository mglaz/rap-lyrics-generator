        "\nI usually don't speak on shit like this, but\nAin't nobody else saying shit\nDaytrip took it to ten (Hey)\n\n\nI usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)\nAin't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence\nThis time, it was so unexpected\nLast time, it was the drugs he was lacing\nAll legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh\nDying young, uh, demon youth\n\n\nWhat's the 27 Club? We ain't making it past 21\nI been going through paranoia, so I always gotta keep a gun\nDamn, that's the world we live in now\nYeah, hold on, just hear me out\nThey tell me I'ma be a legend, I don't want that title now\n'Cause all the legends seem to die out, what the fuck is this 'bout?\nI'm tryna make it out, I'm tryna change the world\nI'm tryna take her out, I'm tryna take your girl\nMore importantly, I'm tryna change the world\nMaybe flex with some diamonds and pearls, yeah\n\n\nI usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)\nAin't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence\nThis time, it was so unexpected\nLast time, it was the drugs he was lacing\nAll legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh\nDying young, uh, demon youth\n\n\nMy mind is foggy, I'm so confused\nWe keep on losing our legends to\nThe cruel cold world, what is it coming to?\nThe end of the world, is it coming soon?\n\n\nNow, ooh, ooh, oh\nThat hit's for you\n\n\nI usually have an answer to the question, but this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)\nAin't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence\nThis time, it was so unexpected\nLast time, it was the drugs he was lacing\nAll legends fall in the making, yeah, sorry truth, uh\nDying young, uh, demon youth\n\n\nDaytrip took it to ten (Hey)"

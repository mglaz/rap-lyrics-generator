        "\n\n\nLive like 9-5, I rhyme and come alive\nMy grind divides fine through my divine eyes\nIt's primetime, you wish you could buy time but it's my time\nThoughts against I, blasphemy, it's like a vice crime\nI roll 'em thick and I ignite mines\nI don't even get high, I just get equally back in my right mind\nI'm getting lethal with these nice lines, creeping through your speakers\nCatch you sleeping like a thief off in the night time\nYoung Doms, none of you niggas correspond, bitch\nKick the fuck out of the track on some Jean-Claude shit\nGet the fuck out of the streets, nigga, I bomb shit\nShit ain't all good no more, y'all on your con shit\nFuck is your conscience? Testing me is nonsense\nThe whole city is mine, I'm the best off in my conference\nAin't feeling me? Fine, ain't gotta listen to my shit\nYou can hear about me from the critics all on my dick\n\n\nBitch, I've been thuggin' since the motherfuckin' ten-speed\nRedbone on my handlebars, I like my bitches mixed-breed\nFill a Philly Titan with a twenty sack of stress weed\nEducated, at the stove I'm working recipes\nReputation say I'm robbin' just for recreation\nRevive my enemy with gun-to-mouth resuscitation\nCan't wait 'til this little pussy nigga pay me, I'm impatient\nLet's go kick in they door and strip 'em naked, leave 'em stinking\nNo witness, no weapon, my nigga, the case is over\nThe reaper snatched him, closed casket, his family need some closure\nAnd Moses had ten commandments, Huey had ten points\nWon't see my homie for ten, dropped him off at the joint\nStaring at my future in my rear-view\nFamily cried some tears, I got some years, it ain't no issue\nMama where the tissue? Saw her breaking down, she just might cry a river\nMurder one, she can't believe she raised that type of nigga\n\n\nI tried to do right, but it only got your boy fucked in the game\nSo I changed my mind, now I'm back on this grind tryna get this change\nNiggas hate to see me getting it, travelling packs with a red dot\nPointed at your knot, trying to get what you got\nWhen the rain and the pain gon' stop?\nStanding on the porch early, no shoes, selling blow in my socks\nAnd I was watching for the ghetto bird\nAin't got no money for college so all I know is how to sack and how to serve\nI be damned if I miss another lick for the chips\nGot me stacking, almost splurging on weed, syrup and whips\nNiggas around my way be loving it, I'm Cadillac-in'\nBlowing good alligators with the belts to match\nI got an ounce with an ounce to match, bust it down, get back\nHopefully maybe get the clique out the trap\nI need dough like a bread baker\n24/7, got ready on the turf, player\nAll day\n\n\nMake 'em hop in the new coupe\nNiggas been winning, that ain't nothing new\nForgive me for the sinning that they be doing in this business\nNot using their words to express truth\nOut in the streets with a screw loose\nOn the Westside I got the juice\nJust tell me what you trying to do\nShe loving the crew and ain't fucking with you\nI go where the hood niggas get into it\nI go where the bad girls go shop\nEvery window tinted but the rooftop\nThat money I just spend it to get you shot\nCan they be hating? They got no reason\nRight where they got me, the place I delete 'em\nWe kicking on weaklings just for they little secrets\nI can't believe it, the shit that I'm seeing\nI'm hearing they words, doing my reading\nIt's really absurd, not enough leaders\nThe shit that they feed you, it's just what you eating\nThey call me young Veggies, I make it go green\nUhh, I smash your whole team, the fuck is you saying?\nYou got the candies, the niggas is spraying\nTo get away and take over the land, yeah\n\n\nMy mind on capital, I'm not just rapping, dude\nI'm out to speak actual factual, watch how a master moves\nYou ball a fist, what that gon do? I'm from a city clapping fools\nYou off the tit lacking while watching me fashion stools\nShitting styles, you never had a hotline that I didn't dial\nLittle princes always trying to fit a bigger crown\nBut don't forget I sit amidst some seasoned gents\nThem bitches knowing he a pimp ain't even need to read the blimp (It was a good day)\nGood day to O'Shea, a death certificate for anyone who lay in my way\nYou best revisit all the tombstones that lay in my wake\nMe being knowledge, be honest\nYou seen the prophet get sacrificed by the opps\nIt get ratchet when ratchets out and they firing\nResidue on pi\u00f1atas, wonder what's up inside of 'em\nIt's sure ain't no Vicodin cause it up and excited 'em\nBut they ain't get high enough, if you ain't succeed, nigga\nBuy again and try again\n\n\nIt's the irrational type of nigga to John Madden tackle you\nSteal your car keys and crash your coupe in the botanical\nWrap you with shackles, tangle you, pull from every angle, dismantle you\nWatch your blood mixed with mud and stain the gravel too\nGrab and shoot, ribcage open like a parachute\nClose range, switchblade, poke 'em if it's personal\nBlood stains, gold fangs, mask on, no trace\nMurder one, closed case, stolen whip, no plates\nHalf a body in the trunk\u2014go to prison? No way\nSpeed off the Brooklyn Bridge before I catch a cold case\nRealize I'm the voice, for those who do not have a voice\nSo I voice my fucking voice, I don't have a fucking choice\nCold blooded, leave some niggas, well I hope you got insurance\nShotgun and shorty lift 'em like the potent in my joint\nBarrels smoking like Red Auerbach\nStill can't believe I'm getting fed on rap\nI don't know what's louder, the pack or the gat\n\n\nMy endorphins are morphin', absorbin' energy\nOriginal copy, \"A Tale of Two Cities\" gets read to me\nReading Emerson novels, eating some Belgian waffles\nSome powder go up my nostrils, my dick going down her tonsils\nWhat's up? Play with an abacus, I've been stressing like Catholics\nThat's the shit, a bit of that happiness in my cup\nThis generation corrupt, these people brainwashed with evil\nMy music is more cerebral, exploring just what you need to\nSo this your exodus, Church of the Methodist\nBeating up the pussy, have her screaming like a exorcist\nAhhhhhh\nAbsorb it through your pores, the Lord with horns, a world war\nWhores are more hors d'oeuvres when it's a world tour\nO'Doyle rules\n\n"

        "\nI got so much shit to do I can't choose what I wanna do first\nHold up pull up on the Hurst fuck the burbs\nFuck you hoe! Talm bout swerve?\nYou ain't even got a car\nI'm off a bar I'm rolling hard\nTake shit to the heart but never to the head bitch you dead\nNow you red like my drank smoking dank bitch you stank\nPull up to the bank I don't have no time to think about no hoe\nGet out my face is you gay pull up broad day we can play\nJust did a feature and bought an AK\n\n\nAll these niggas and these bitches straight up fans\nDo it for my fam never for the gram\nI roll up some grams bitch I get it in my choppa got a twin and I got a stick\n40 with the dick now yeah I'm with the shits\nBitch you better not I came up off the block\nGrew up in the jets now I got a check bitch come correct\nSneaking dissing me be direct cause you know like I know I'll whoop yo ass\nIf I wasn't smoke and gas where I wanna when I wanna\nPull up on ya on that gang shit\nBitch you know we hanging shit\nMy lil brother thirteen he a fucking savage he be holding them straps and shit\nGive him macs techs and sticks\nMy big brother got them bricks\nI got so much shit to do I can't choose what I wanna what\nHold up pull up on the hearse fuck the burbs\nTalking bout swerve fuck you hoe\nGang gang aye\n\n\nI got so much shit to do I can't choose what I wanna do first\nHold up pull up on the hearse fuck the burbs\nFuck you hoe!

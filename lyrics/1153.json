        "\nYeah, Ben Sommers\n\n\nI been crazy, my shit hazy\nDon't mistake me, little bitch shady\nAin't shit phase me, Slim Jesus\nHoe ass should be Mrs. Jesus\nPut me up on a flag, I can't fit on no t-shirt\nMy city mini-Chiraq, let's beef turf and you'll bleed first\nI don't got a gang, just rap good\nBut we can see who's that good\nI take the trash to the back woods\nAnother white boy wanna act hood\nGot a bad feeling, you feel me son\nRap verse, it might leave you hung\nLook close in that video I saw orange tips on your BB guns\nI hate you, zero bitch if I rate you\nYou walk around and don't make moves\nAnd you couldn't rap if I paid you\nSo what the fuck does it take to\nMake you to take a break or fucking take two\nI need one take, don't take two\nYou got somethin like  better make room\nGot eight goons in your music vid\nStupid clips they intimidate\nShit-shit you say is so simplistic\nI don't think a single person been amazed\nPip-squeak Chief Keef imitator\nAll I need is that pen and paper\nName is Jesus but Ben's the savior\nMake sure your ass missed your paced up\nHeating it frequently, you are not beating, defeating\nComing up so fucking recently\nThis be a side people ain't seen in me\nKilling your ass and I'm doing it decently\nReal gritty, ugly boy but I'm still pretty\nYou cosign with Lil Bibby, that's real nifty\nYour wack ass still can't deal with me, aaah"

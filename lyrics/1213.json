        "\nYeah, ride the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood\nMore bookings and payments that shit done got huge (Shit done got huge)\nHop in the spaceship, take it to the moon (Gone)\nChrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool (Yeah)\nHer pussy stay wet, we don't gotta use lube (Lube)\nGood head on her shoulders like she still in school (Uh)\nPour fours in my soda, I won't catch a flu\nLoyalty mandatory, you part of this crew (Part of this crew)\nSpending addiction, ten thousand on shoes (Spending addiction)\nSpend with no limit, a hundred on jewels (A hundred on jewels)\nToo many bitches, they coming in twos\nI took a Perc', I been itching since noon (Itching since noon)\nWhy the brokest the loudest in the room? (Loudest)\nWhy all the sudden niggas want to be cool? (Want to be cool)\nAin't giving second chances, I'm no fool (Nah)\nI'm out my depression, life been going smooth\n\n\nBonds in my session, backend through the roof\nYou gon' make some money, book me for a show\nMost of my classmates thought I was a joke\nNow look at their faces, I done gave 'em hope\nBlue Phantom, I'm like I need me one of those\nI built my name up to help the business grow\nShe freaky, pulled up without no pantyhose\nI'm stacking these benjamins, try not to boast\nBought some exclusive drip on Melrose\nFuck the judge, gave my cousin elbow\nLocked him up, put him in a hellhole\nThey hope that he rotting out in mildew\nAin't seen him since my first year of high school\nI'ma pay his way out for 'bout a mill' or two\nTen years riding, I made sure he had some food\nI held that shit down, now look what we can do\n\n\nRide the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood\nMore bookings and payments that shit done got huge (Shit done got huge)\nHop in the spaceship, take it to the moon (Gone)\nChrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool (Yeah)\nHer pussy stay wet, we don't gotta use lube (Lube)\nGood head on her shoulders like she still in school (Uh)\nPour fours in my soda, I won't catch a flu\nLoyalty mandatory, you part of this crew (Part of this crew)\nSpending addiction, ten thousand on shoes (Spending addiction)\nSpend with no limit, a hundred on jewels (A hundred on jewels)\nToo many bitches, they coming in twos\nI took a Perc', I been itching since noon (Itching since noon)\nWhy the brokest the loudest in the room? (Loudest)\nWhy all the sudden niggas want to be cool? (Want to be cool)\nAin't giving second chances, I'm no fool (Nah)\nI'm out my depression, life been going smooth (Yeah)\n\n\nCrew full of winners, no way we can lose\nI learned from mistakes, won't take another loss\nVibes in the Sprinter, headed to the mall\nI rock flawless diamonds, please accept my flaws\nI'm getting that money, money over all\nIf broke is your problem cash is gonna solve it\nIf she sell pussy better have some bond nigga\nHit you up high, you leaping like a frog (Frog)\nMaking these hits, I'm feeling like a batter\nBought myself a ladder, I'ma stack it tall (Tall)\nGunna don't pay attention to these blogs\nThey saying shit, I let this money talk (Oh, yeah)\nDiamonds on me look like some glass shattered\nMy bitch's ass fatter, keep a nigga hard (Oh, yeah)\nCars got some custom seats, they can massage\nConvertible coming at the end of March\n\n\nRide the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood\nMore bookings and payments that shit done got huge (Shit done got huge)\nHop in the spaceship, take it to the moon (Gone)\nChrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool (Yeah)\nHer pussy stay wet, we don't gotta use lube (Lube)\nGood head on her shoulders like she still in school (Uh)\nPour fours in my soda, I won't catch a flu\nLoyalty mandatory, you part of this crew (Part of this crew)\nSpending addiction, ten thousand on shoes (Spending addiction)\nSpend with no limit, a hundred on jewels (A hundred on jewels)\nToo many bitches, they coming in twos\nI took a Perc', I been itching since noon (Itching since noon)\nWhy the brokest the loudest in the room?

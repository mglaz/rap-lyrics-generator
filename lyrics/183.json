        "\nI can see what's happening (I can't, what?)\nAnd they don't have a clue (Who's they?)\nThey'll fall in love and here's the bottom line\nOur trio's down to two (Oh, I get it)\nThe sweet caress of twilight (Yep)\nThere's magic everywhere (It's everywhere)\nAnd with all this romantic atmosphere\nDisaster's in the air\n\n\nCan you feel the love tonight?\nThe peace the evening brings\nThe world, for once, in perfect harmony\nWith all its living things\n\n\nSo many things to tell her\nBut how to make her see\nThe truth about my past? Impossible\nShe'd turn away from me\n\n\nHe's holding back, he's hiding\nBut what, I can't decide\nWhy won't he be the king I know he is\nThe king I see inside?\n\n\nCan you feel the love tonight?\nThe peace the evening brings\nThe world, for once, in perfect harmony\nWith all its living things\nCan you feel the love tonight?\nYou needn't look too far\nStealing through the night's uncertainties\nLove is where they are\n\n\nAnd if he falls in love tonight\nIt can be assumed\nHis carefree days with us are history\nIn short, our pal is doomed"

        "\nI'll be by your side, I'll always find a way\nGeneral, we got these niggas\nFucking cockroaches, you wanna go to war? HA-HAAAEEH!\nI love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love\nI'd find you\n\n\n(By your side)\nIt makes me strong\nIt gives me the strength to bang out and make these songs\nIf I do it on the spot or if it takes me long\nThey can't stop me, even if my brakes was on\nI'm still (by your side)\nI'm always here, nobody\u2019s perfect, life ain't always fair\nI used to not give a fuck, I ain't always care\nWhen it\u2019s too hot for the hammer\nYou know the hawk is right (by your side)\nUntil you get to the car\nAnd you gotta get through the D before you get to the R\nIf I don't get you today then I'ma get you tomorrow\nAs soon as you come out your crib I'ma be right (by your side)\nWhere I\u2019m supposed to be\nClose to you, with the toast close to me\nAnd screw it if it\u2019s the right or the wrong thing\nWhen you in the sight of that long thing\nYou wish you had a strong team (by your side)\n\n\nI love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love\nI'd find you\nBy your side, by your side\nI love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love\nI'd find you\n\n\nAs long as you need me\nI'm down for whatever homie as long as you feed me\nI pull the big joints out as long as the TV\nOr I can play my part and just breathe easy, right (by your side)\nAs soon as something happen to you\nYour niggas are bouncin' and you thought they were scrappin' witcha you\nNow you cleanin' your cuts with peroxide\nAnd you wake up in the ER with the Doc, right (by your side)\nPuttin tubes in you\nAnd you can\u2019t even eat right, they puttin\u2019 food in you\nYour body\u2019s getting colder, Devil on your shoulder\nAnd your moms is in the room but you just wanna hold her (by your side)\nNothin but realness\nThat's why everybody in the world could feel this\nI'm on top and y'all under me\nSo when it's over; if I ain't in the front\nAt least I'm gonna be (by your side)\n\n\nI love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love\nI'd find you\nBy your side, by your side\nI love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love\nI'd find you\n\n\nUntil they finish me off\nIf they don't get us both you'll be sending me off\nAnd please just do me this favor: stick to our little plan\nAnd fuck the money, just keep my little man (by your side)\nAnd show 'em there's hope\nAnd he gon' think he know how it's going\nBut show him the ropes\nAnd if you bring him to the Gucci store, show him the loafs\nHood niggas I'm just showing you growth\nBut I'm still right (by your side)\nYou know Kiss\nDon't gotta aim his gun at you to be focused\nAnd if you broke now nigga when you see those chips\nWatch how many people come out of nowhere\nAnd try to be (by your side)\nThe answer's plenty\n'Cause when you, handling business you can't be friendly\nAnd if you, tryin to stack something can't be pennies\nMost likely Grants and Benjies\nAnd you better keep 'em (by your side)\n\n\nI love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love\nI'd find you\nBy your side, by your side\nI love you too much to lose your sweet touch and your love\nI'd find you\nBy your side\nBy your side\nBy your side\nBy your side"

        "\nWhite lines, pretty baby, tattoos\nDon't know what they mean\nThey're special, just for you\nWhite palms, baking powder on the stove\nCooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow\n\n\nI feel you, pretty baby, feel me\nTurn it up hot, loving you is free\nI like it down, like it down way low\nBut you already know that\nYou already know\n(Fuck!)\n\n\nCome on down to Florida\nI got something for ya\nWe could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah\nGuns in the summertime\nChic-a-Cherry Cola lime\nPrison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side\n\n\nYayo, yayo, yayo\nAnd all the dope fiends\nYayo, yayo, yayo\n(Fuck!)\n\n\nSun in my mouth and gold hoops\nYou like your little baby like you like your drinks, cool\nWhite lines, pretty daddy, go skiing\nYou snort it like a champ, like the winter we're not in\n(Fuck!)\n\n\nCome on down to Florida\nI got something for ya\nWe could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah\nGuns in the summertime\nChic-a-Cherry Cola lime\nPrison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side\n\n\nYayo, yayo, yayo\nAnd all the dope fiends\nYayo, yayo, yayo\n\n\nWe could get high in Miami\nOoh, ooh\nDance the night away\nPeople never die in Miami\nOoh, ooh\nThat's what they all say (Yay)\n\n\n(You believe me, don't you baby?)\n\n\nCome on down to Florida\nI got something for ya\nWe could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah\nGuns in the summertime\nChic-a-Cherry Cola lime\nPrison don't mean nothing to me if you'll be by my side\n\n\nYayo, yayo, yayo\nAll the Floridians like\nYayo, yayo, yayo\nAll the Colombians like\nYayo, yayo, yayo\nAnd all my girlfriends\nYayo, yayo, yayo\n\n\nThat's how we do it, like\nMm-mm, pretty baby\nWhite lines, pretty baby\nGold teeth, pretty baby\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nDance the night away"

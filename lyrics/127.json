        "\nIt will all be over soon\n\n\nAnd I'm always where the sun don't shine\nThe tears don't show, won't hurt me now\n'Cause heart's been broke, I hate myself\nBut it won't show, I constantly lose all\nMy remorse, and it's ten for the wolf and\nThree for the shepherd, and it's one for the sheep who\nLed by your leopard, often gave his perception as a\nHandle of weapon, took a bite of your apple, give me\nAll you can offer,  now I'm trapped in a changing maze\nSetting my soul ablaze, couldn't control the pace\nWhere is this going? Hey, heartless is recklessness, it's\nWord of a pacifist to word of a masochist, I'm\nOff of the map, my Lord, I spoke to a Baphomet, he\nSaid he would save me if I gave him one thing he needed\n\"What is this thing?\", I pleaded; boy, it's the key to even, yeah\n\n\nAnd as I spoke, my fangs were shown\nTaken aback, he smiles and tells me\n\"What you crave will soon be yours\nBut what I crave is already mine\"\nAnima vestra\nAnima\nAnima vestra\nAnima"

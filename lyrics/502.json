        "\nIt's a mad world out here, I tell you\nThe world's gone stark, raving mad\nEveryone in the world is mad\nIt's a mad crazy world\n\n\nI see diamond-flooded demons\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\n\n\nWith a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure\nPulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword\nWrites a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door\nJust the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord\nListen not to what he speaks, that's been the cursing of his cause\nA seduction of his senses by the devils he adores\nThe unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war\nFollow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward\nShun him while in public disallow him from your stores\nHave no part in his affairs 'less his pestilence be yours\nMake scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores\nBut we must still pray that his color will be cured\n\n\nI see diamond-flooded demons\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\n\n\nWith her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain\nHe looks back into the crowd, wipes the blood and then explains\nHow she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged\nHer becoming must be halted to reverse what she became\nFrom the looseness of her tongue, to the pollution of her aims\nTo do nothing is barbaric, the solution is humane\nYou must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain\nYou torture out the wildness, then replace it with the tame\nBlank slate when she recovers, she won't even know her name\nPerfect wife and perfect lover, no resistance, no complaints\nMay God bless the scientific cure for the insane\nKnew she couldn't go to school, but she thought that that should change\n\n\nI see diamond-flooded demons\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\n\n\nWith his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine\nPut his Bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind\nTold him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine\nNow the little boy think it's normal because they do this all the time\nWith no life inside his body now he finally think he\u2019s safe\nBut they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face\nHe take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states\nNow he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped\nWith the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens\nDoesn\u2019t mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins\nHe forgives them in advance says that he will do again\n\n\nMy fellow Americans...\n\n\nI see diamond-flooded demons\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through"

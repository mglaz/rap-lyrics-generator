        "\nThis life shit, this life shit is like\nIs like bugged the fuck out, son, for real\nSee, to live is to suffer\nBut to survive\u2026\nWell, that's to find meaning in the suffering\n\n\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\n\nI've been through mad different phases like mazes to find my way\nAnd now I know that happy days are not far away\nIf I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids\nDoin' somethin' more constructive with their time than bids\nI know because I been there, now I'm in there\nSit back and look at what it took for me to get there\nFirst came the bullshit, the drama with my mama\nShe got on some fly shit so I split and said that I'ma\nBe that seed that doesn't need much to succeed\nStrapped with mad greed and a heart that doesn't bleed\nI'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was\nBaggin' niggas when I caught a buzz\nFor thinkin' about how short I was\nGoin' too fast, it wouldn't last, but yo I couldn't tell\nGroup homes and institutions prepared my ass for jail\nThey put me in a situation forcin' me to be a man\nWhen I was just learnin' to stand without a helping hand\nDamn, was it my fault, somethin' I did\nTo make a father leave his first kid at seven doin' my first bid?\nBack on the scene at fourteen with a scheme\nTo get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream\nAnd by all means I will be livin' high off the hog\nAnd I never gave a fuck about much but my dog\nThat's my only mothafucka I hit off with my last\nJust another lil nigga headed nowhere fast\n\n\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\n\nThat ain't the half, shit gets worse as I get older\nActions become bolder, heart got colder\nChip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch\nDidn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much\nOne deep with the pit startin' shit for kicks\nCatchin' Vicks, throwin' bricks, gettin' by bein' slick\nUsed to get high, just to get by\nUsed to have to puff my L in the morning before I could fly\nAte somethin', a couple of forties made me hate somethin'\nI did some coke, now I'm ready to take somethin'\nThree years later showin' signs of stress\nDidn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed\nI'm possessed by the darker side, livin' the cruddy life\nShit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife\nWanna make records but I'm fuckin' it up\nI'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\n\n\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\n\nWasn't long before I hit rock bottom\nNiggas talkin' shit, was like, \"Damn, look how that rock got him!\"\nOpen like a window, no more indo\nLook at a video, sayin' to myself: \"That coulda been yo\nAss on the TV,\" believe me, it could be done\nSomethin's got to give, gots to change 'cause now I've got a son\nI gots to do the right thing for shorty\nAnd that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s\nSo I get back lookin' type slick again\nFake niggas jump back on my dick again\nNothin' but love for those that know how it feel\nAnd much respect to all my niggas that kept it real\nKept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doin' wrong\nNiggas know who they is and this is your fuckin' song\nAnd to my boo who stuck with a nigga through\nAll the bullshit, you'll get yours because it's due\n\n\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up\nGet me back on my feet so I can tear shit up\n\n\nSee, this is that shit, this is that shit\nThat all real niggas can relate to\nThis is from the heart, baby\nDon't get it twisted\nX, baby"

Get your Vaseline\nRoll some weed with some tissue and close your eyes\nThen imagine your tongue in between my thighs\nBaby, oh, yes oh!\nJailer, open up cell, block eight\nAlright nigga, that's enough\nStop, look and listen, get back to your position\nKim got your dick hard, startin' fights in the yard\nHotter than a Pop Tart fresh out of the toaster\nNiggas do anything for a Lil' Kim poster\nEses, Bloods, Crips, all the thugs\nUp North in the hole, they all wanna know\n\n\nSo, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n('Cause I've got to know)\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Tell me)\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Oh, oh)\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\n\nIf you drivin' in the street hold on to your seat\nNiggas, grab your meat while I ride the beat\nAnd if you see a shiny black Lamborghini fly by ya\n(Shoom!) That's me the Knight Rider\nDressed in all black with the gat in the lap\nLunatics in the street, gotta keep the heat\nSixty on the bezel, a hunnid on the rings\nSittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling\n12 a.m., I'm on the way to the club\nAfter three bottles I'll be ready to fuck\nSome niggas even put me on their grocery list\nRight next to the whip cream and box of chocolate\nDesigner pussy, my shit come in flavors\nHigh-class taste, niggas got to spend paper\nLick it right the first time or you gotta do it over\nLike it's rehearsal for a Tootsie commercial\n\n\nSo, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n('Cause I've got to know)\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Tell me)\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Oh, oh)\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)\nSo, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Tell me)\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Tell me, let me know)\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Oh, oh)\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)\nSo, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Yeah)\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Oh, oh)\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Baby, tell me)\nSo, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh)\nHow many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)"

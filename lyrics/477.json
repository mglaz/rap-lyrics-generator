        "\n30!\nColder than them grits they fed slaves\nMe to rap is like water to raves\nAK's with bayonets on deck, rep my set\nSorta like Squidward and his clarinet\nI'm in ya bitch mouth but she fantasizing\nStaring at the skinnies, said it's so tantalizing\nDog I'm strategizing, plotting on the throne\nThe masta of the ace sitting on chrome\nDark nights tryna sleep stomach on fire\nDelusional from hunger so I couldn't get tired\nImagining the equalizer goin' from green to red\nWords that rhyme together just appear all in my head\nAnd I'm sorta like Neo with the Matrix code\nI try to escape it hoping the drugs'll numb my soul\nSay I'm getting old and time's running out\nRepeating instrumentals, tryna figure patterns out\nI never leave the house, ain't slept in three days\nPopping pills, writing, drinking and smoking haze\nWeaving kicks and snares, tryna dodge these hooks\nKeepin' it original, something that's overlooked\nThe way a nigga going might go out like Sam Cooke\nOr locked up calling home for money on my books\n'Cause if this shit don't work, nigga, I failed at life\nTurning to these drugs, now these drugs turned my life\nAnd it's the downward spiral, got me suicidal\nBut too scared to do it so these pills will be the rifle\nSurpassing all my idols, took the wrong turn\nBut can't go back now so let that blunt burn\n'Cause now it's my turn if I fuck it all up\nTook a while to get here now I depend on these drugs\nI took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs\nTriple X"

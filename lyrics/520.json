        "\nSeinfield: Getting engaged is like getting, uh, it's the first hill of the roller coaster\nAnd you hear those clickers, the loud sound - this really violent, metal\n'Chunka-chunka-chunka' and you go, \"What, what's going on here,\" You know?\n\"Boy this thing is really, really goes high!\"\nWale: I'm looking down, 'Oh shit!'\nSeinfield: And then you go over the top, the wedding is at the top. You go over the top, is the wedding and then you're just screaming\nWale: Even if you make plans you never think you're really ready for marriage?\nSeinfield: No it's uh, it's like any growth. You're no- you can't be ready for it because tha- it's growth, it's gonna be new. It's gonna be new. You're gonna have a new life, you're gonna be a new person\n\n\nCouldn't make you wait forever, for forever\nThis is forever\nI gotchu\n\n\nIf there's a question of my heart, you've got it\nIt don't belong to anyone but you\nIf there's a question of my love, you've got it\nBaby, don't worry, I've got plans for you\nBaby, I've been making plans, oh love\nBaby, I've been making plans for you\nBaby, I've been making plans\nBaby, I've been making plans for you\n\n\n(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)\nLook, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic\nThat I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding\nGuess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well\nIt\u2019s not your fault they try get me cause I'ma need the sales\nCause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself\nTryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel\nCause I failed and see you 'bout to cry\nCause when I enter they city they leave without they pride\nI'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments\nFearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them\nWrong, how dare I say ignore them?\nPreparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them\nIt's hard, you know temptation and all\nBitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong\nGet a place in the charts or runaway from your heart\nGave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong\n\n\nBut I'm promisin' you better though\nAnd your friends sayin', \"let him go\"\nAnd we ain't gettin' any younger\nI can give up now, but I can promise you forever though\n\n\nIf there's a question of my heart, you've got it\nIt don't belong to anyone but you\nIf there's a question of my love, you've got it\nBaby, don't worry, I've got plans for you\nBaby, I've been making plans, oh love\nBaby, I've been making plans for you\nBaby, I've been making plans\nBaby, I've been making plans for you\n\n\n(Realest shit I ever wrote, realest shit I ever wrote\nRealest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)\nI\u2019ll admit it, let me be hypothetic\nThe day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it\nThe idea of me finding love, would run somebody off\nAnd true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss\nBrush you off, see I'm kinda lost\nNow I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons\nAnd dark, good nigga, troubled heart\nWent from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart\nThis is hard, tryna find some time to move on\nCause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark\nSoft, and I thank you baby, you strong\nMy ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long\nNah, good terms how that ended\nBut it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business\nOff white picket fences, on flights with the children\nOn site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but\n\n\nBut I plan to do it better though\nBut you still sayin' let it go\nWe ain't gettin' any younger\nWomen love me now but in your eyes we forever though\n\n\nIf there's a question of my heart, you've got it\nIt don't belong to anyone but you\nIf there's a question of my love, you've got it\nBaby, don't worry, I've got plans for you\nBaby, I've been making plans, oh baby\nI've been making plans, oh love\nBaby, I've been making plans for you\nBaby, I've been making plans\nBaby, I've been making plans for you\n\n\nWe ain't nothin' but some planets\n\nSeinfield: I always feel like I\u2019m a planet. And these other women that are, kinda moving through this solar system with me. And, marriage is like you decide to jump off of your planet, across to another planet. And you can only do it when one planet passes real close. And you look and you go, \u201cHey, I think I can jump across.\u201d"

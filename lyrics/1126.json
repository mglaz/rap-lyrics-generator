        "\nMind\nMind\n\n\nSittin' all alone\nMouth full of gum\nIn the driveway\nMy friends aren't far\nIn the back of my car\nLay their bodies\n\n\nWhere's my mind?\nWhere's my mind?\n\n\nThey'll be here pretty soon\nLookin' through my room\nFor the money\nI'm bitin' my nails\nI'm too young to go to jail\nIt's kinda funny\n\n\nWhere's my mind?\nWhere's my mind?\nWhere's my mind?\nWhere's my mind?\n\n\nMaybe it's in the gutter\nWhere I left my lover\nWhat an expensive fake\nMy V is for Vendetta\nThought that I'd feel better\nBut now I got a bellyache\n(Mind)\n\n\nEverything I do\nThe way I wear my noose\nLike a necklace\nI wanna make 'em scared\nLike I could be anywhere\nLike I'm reckless\n\n\nI lost my mind\nI don't mind\nWhere's my mind?\nWhere's my mind?\n\n\nMaybe it's in the gutter\nWhere I left my lover\nWhat an expensive fake\nMy V is for Vendetta\nThought that I'd feel better\nBut now I got a bellyache\n(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache\nBellyache, bellyache)\nMaybe it's in the gutter\nWhere I left my lover\nWhat an expensive fake\nMy V is for Vendetta\nThought that I'd feel better\nBut now I got a bellyache"

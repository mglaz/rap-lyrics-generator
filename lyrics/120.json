        "\nI know you so well, so well\nI mean, I can do anything he can\nI've been pretty\u2014\n\n\nI know you're somewhere, somewhere\nI've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on\nI don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing\nI've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)\n\n\nI'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain\nI've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change\nSuicidal, same time I'm tame\nPicture this, in bed, get a phone call\nGirl that you fucked with killed herself\nThat was this summer when nobody helped\nAnd ever since then, man, I hate myself\nWanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic\nAll wanna see me with no pot to piss in\nBut niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'\nHavin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions\nFuckin' sickenin'; at the same time\nMemories surface through the grapevine\n'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot\nPost-traumatic stress got me fucked up\nBeen fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up\n\n\nI'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on\nAnd I don't feel the same, I'm so numb\nI'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on\nAnd I don't feel the same, I'm so numb\n\n\nI know you so well (I know you, girl)\nI mean, I can do better than he can\nI've been pretty\u2014\nI know you so well"

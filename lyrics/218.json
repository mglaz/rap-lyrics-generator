        "\nIt's either, them or you\nIt's sort of like, survival you know. Survival of the fittest you know\nYou do what you do to stay alive\n\n\nNiggas don't want war\u2014I'm a martian, with an army of spartans\nSparring with a knife in a missile fight\nGet your intel right; your intelligence is irrelevant\nBut it's definite; I spit more than speech impediments\nBrooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident\nWe got them niggas P-E-Nuts\u2014like they elephants\nThrow 'em in a trunk if they hate though\nWe don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay, so\nYa'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here\nI got them girls next to the wood like they light year, I'm right chea\nTryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate\nSTEEZ got that presidential shit time to inaugurate\nMy P.E.-conglomerates 'bout to P-E-E on any wanna-B-E, weak MC\nAir 'em out or leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto\nFire flame-spitter like komodo\nNo time for fake people, they be Simmin' like Kimora\nI'm the empor-ah in search of Theodora, my heart go\n\"Ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom-boom\"\nIt's panic like Dora when shots blast\nSee I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that 'K\nLike every day in every way, and every where you go, just ain't safe\nThe only thing that I can say, to you is, \"Pray\"\n'Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in\nYour blood drippin', and got you slippin'\nAnother victim, don't know what's hit them\u2014through his spinal\nJust another man who defeated by survival\nThat's your biggest rival, in your whole life\nThese bars you can't handle you better hold tight\nThey sayin' I'm the best\u2014I'm like, \"You're so right\"\nStill ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga\n\n\nYo, fuck the police nigga\nFuck every ass-corrupt politician on Wall Street\nP.E., Public Enemy, Assassinate us\u2014bitch\nFuck that, fuck everything, son\nFuck government, fuck\u2014listenin' and shit\nYou want fuckin' energy? Dickheads\n\n\nIt's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one\nDoomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns\nNew gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps\nBetter play your cards right, no booster packs\nEverybody claim they used to rap\nBut these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks\nLeaving instrumentals blue and black\nI'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back\nRiding on hoverboards, wiping out motherboards\nStopped spitting fire 'cause my motherfuckin' lung is scorched\nKing Arthur when he swung his sword\nA king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four\nI had a hard time writing lyrics\nNow I'm way over heads, science fiction\nYou can try and get it, my man the flyest with it\nWouldn't mind a feign of interest for your finest interest\nThey say hard work pays off\nWell tell the Based God don't quit his day job\n'Cause P.E.'s about to take off\nWith protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb\nFuckin' ridiculous\nFinger to the president screamin', \"Fuck censorship!\"\nIf Obama got that president election\nThen them P.E. boys bout to make an intervention\nFuck what I once said, I want the blood shed\n'Cause now-a-days for respect you gotta pump lead\nI guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan\nAnd Pok\u00e9mon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con\nIt's like we've been content with losin'\nAnd half our students fallen victim to the institution\nJobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution\nAnd little kids are shootin' Uzi's 'cause its given to 'em\nLittle weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson\nAnd you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception\nIf your man\u2019s tryna disrespect it\nSend a message and it's over in a millisecond\u2014nigga\n\n"

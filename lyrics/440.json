        "\nYou said you'd never ever break... down\nBut here I am sweeping... pieces off of the ground\nYou said you'd never, ever play... to crowds\nBut I've seen you hoping to play songs to them now\nI've spent all night long scared of tomorrow, I broke my alarm\nEverything is almost lost, pick it up slow, before it's gone...\n\n\nWe\u2019re fragile\n(Wish I\u2019d have known)\nI never thought I\u2019d be so fragile\n(You\u2019re not alone)\nIf it didn\u2019t break before, it\u2019s about to\n(We\u2019ve been here before)\nI don\u2019t ever want to change\nI\u2019m fragile\nI don\u2019t ever want\u2026\nI don't ever...\n\n\nSome of the people appointed to give an opinion\nNever do get it\nI want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and... die\nN9na be givin the remedy and why?\nCritics are really the enemy and I\nCan't stand the way they slam today's gifted\nEffin' incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay\nThis jam will lay scripted\nDeaf and impeccable\nWrite a rhyme and I put everything in a flow\nI'm the N9ne I'ma look very mean\nWhen a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show\nBy the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto\nCause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes\nAmateur writer dissin'\nHe's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks I'ma despise\nNever do try to listen\nIt's real - I'm mad\nClueless when you scribble on your pad\nHow you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad\nYou don't really get why I'm so pissed? Understand this:\nI'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shit, yes I'm\n\n\nWe\u2019re fragile\n(Wish I\u2019d have known)\nI never thought I\u2019d be so fragile\n(You\u2019re not alone)\nIf it didn\u2019t break before, it\u2019s about to\n(We\u2019ve been here before)\nI don\u2019t ever want to change\nI\u2019m fragile\nI don\u2019t ever want\u2026\nI don't ever...\n\n\nTell me that I'm famous\nTell me that my name is\nBig as Venus Jupiter and then Uranus\nTell me that your anus got your head in it\nI can smell the articles and know you're heinous\nTell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me\nUnconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favourite\nGrab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks\nThat's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'\nOn this pen, on this pad\nTell me you're willin' to diss on my craft\nTell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track\nStop...\nPuttin' my heart and my soul in these lines\nTellin' me platinum and gold all the time\nLookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine\nDrop...\nThis is more than you, and this is more than you\nAnd your entire building slanderin' and abusin'\nWhat I call the realest comin' from a student\nTold myself to use a poem as an UZI\nEmpty magazine, I seen a magazine\nYou seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'\nThat was nicotine, I'm bout to smoke 'em all\nAnd journalists involved should've known my music\n\n\nWe\u2019re fragile\n(Wish I\u2019d have known)\nI never thought I\u2019d be so fragile\n(You\u2019re not alone)\nIf it didn\u2019t break before, it\u2019s about to\n(We\u2019ve been here before)\nI don\u2019t ever want to change\nI\u2019m fragile\nI don\u2019t ever want\u2026\nI don't ever..."

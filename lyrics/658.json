        "\n\n\nA-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop\nTo the beat, y'all, and you don't stop\nYes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop\nA-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop\nA-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop\nAnd to the beat Com Sense'll be the sure shot, come on\n\n\nI met this girl when I was ten years old\nAnd what I loved most, she had so much soul\nShe was old school when I was just a shorty\nNever knew throughout my life she would be there for me\nOn the regular, not a church girl, she was secular\nNot about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her\nBut I respected her, she hit me in the heart\nA few New York niggas had did her in the park\nBut she was there for me, and I was there for her\nPull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her\nAnd just cool out, cool out, and listen to her\nSittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her\nEventually if it was meant to be, then it would be\n\u2018Cause we related, physically and mentally\nAnd she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around\nSlim was fresh, joe, when she was underground\nOriginal, pure, untampered, a down sister\nBoy, I tell you, I miss her\n\n\nA-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop\nTo the beat, y'all, and you don't stop\nA-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop\nA-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop\nA-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop\nA-Com Sense y'all, and you don't stop\nA-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop\nUAC, yo, we gotta be the sure shot\n\n\nNow periodically I would see\nOl' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties\nShe didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick\nDid a couple of videos and became Afrocentric\nOut goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions\nShe was on that tip about stoppin' the violence\nAbout my people she was teachin' me\nBy not preachin' to me but speakin' to me\nIn a method that was leisurely, so easily I approach\nShe dug my rap, that's how we got close\nBut then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool\nCause around the same time, I went away to school\nAnd I'm a man of expandin', so why should I stand in her way?\nShe probably get her money in L.A\nAnd she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul\nShe said that the pro-black was goin' out of style\nShe said, \"Afrocentricity was of the past\"\nSo she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz\nNow black music is black music and it's all good\nI wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood\nCause that was good for her, she was becomin' well-rounded\nI thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit\nJust havin' fun, not worried about anyone\nAnd you could tell by how her titties hung\n\n\nA-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop\nTo the beat, y'all, and you don't stop\nA-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop\nA-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop\nA-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop\nAnd to the beat Com gotta be the sure shot\nA-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop\nIf you don't check it, mm-mm, bust it, bust it\n\n\nI might've failed to mention that this chick was creative\nOnce the man got to her, he altered her native\nTold her if she got an image and a gimmick\nThat she could make money, and she did it like a dummy\nNow I see her in commercials, she's universal\nShe used to only swing it with the inner-city circle\nNow she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie\nAnd on some dumb shit when she comes to the city\nTalkin' bout poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches\nNow she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches\nAlways smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk\nTellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk\nStressin' how hardcore and real she is\nShe was really the realest, before she got into showbiz\nI did her, not just to say that I did it\nBut I'm committed (girl, he's committed) but so many niggas hit it\nThat she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her\nI see niggas slammin' her and takin' her to the sewer\nBut I'ma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop\n\u2018Cause who I'm talkin' about, y'all, is hip-hop\n\n\nTo the beat, y'all, and you don't stop\nA-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop\nMainframe, yo, they gotta be the sure shot\nA-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop\nTo the beat, y'all, and you don't stop\nA-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop\nA-one, two, Com Sense is gonna drop, haha\n\n\nI used to love H.E.R\nI used to love H.E.R\nI used to love H.E.R\nI used to love H.E.R\nI used to love H.E.R\nI used to love H.E.R\nI used to love H.E.R., went and fucked up all the shit, y'all\n\n\nYou ain't got your woman in check, man?\nI think you\u2019re overstepping your bounds just a little bit\nI can't do this anymore"

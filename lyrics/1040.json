        "\nSome people call me Shanie, some people call me Rox\nAnd those who try to diss I just knocks them out the box\nCos I'm Shant\u00e9 and y'all know the routine\nAnd here we go again, so all hail the queen\nI left you for a while but it was worth the wait\nBecause it gave me just enough time to create\nA funky rhythm that's guaranteed to move the world\nHave the party people screaming out, \"Go on Girl!\"\nJust like Diana Ross, I'm the boss\nAnd those who disapprove you can go for yours\nBut to think a girl like me, ha, is easy to take\nYou should treat me like Nell Carter, give me a break\nCause I'm the super female that's called Shant\u00e9\nAnd like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away\nWhenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play\nSo you best go about your way and have a nice day\n\n\nA lotta MCs today really know how to please\nBut I gave birth to most of them MCs\nSo when it comes around to the month of May\nSend me your royalty check for Mother's Day\nBecause yo, ya know, ya can't deal with this\nI'm Shant\u00e9 the microphone grandmistress\nA pioneer like Lola Folana\nWith a name that stands big like Madonna\nSpeaking of Madonna, some girls on the mic\nRap like virgins and get real tight\nBut I get loose with the rhymes I produce\nThat's why I'm queen of the crew with the juice\nCos I'm the super female that's called Shant\u00e9\nAnd like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away\nWhenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play\nSo you best go about your way and have a nice day\n\n\nShant\u00e9, the baddest around\nAnd a name like that can be broken down\nAs Supreme Highness Almighty Noble Topics Exponent\nAnd any title for a girl, you can believe I own it\nCause to me there ain't nothing fresher\nFor me to rock..my pleasure\nI'll pick up the microphone and start rocking\nSay the funky rhymes that have the people clocking\nMe, the S-H-A-N-T-E\nGood looking, never tooken female MC\nI'm five foot four, maybe a little bigger\nBrown skin complexion with a nice figure\nYes, the super female that's called Shant\u00e9\nAnd like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away\nWhenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play\nSo you best go about your way and have a nice day\n\n\nYou may remember the voice from a few years ago\nWhen I first came out and dissed UTFO\nI chilled for a while, I put down my pen\nBut now some suckas from the Bronx got me started again\nNow I'm not out to diss the whole Boogie Down\nJust a featherweight crew from that part of town\nYou made a little record and then you start fronting\nTried to diss the Juice Crew but ain't hurt nothing\nNow KRS-ONE, you should go on vacation\nWith that name sounding like a wack radio station\nAnd as for Scott La Rock, you should be ashamed\nWhen T La Rock said \"It's Yours\", he didn't mean his name\nSo step back, peasants, popping all that junk\nOr else BDP will stand for Broken Down Punks\nCause I'm an all-star just like Julius Erving\nAnd Roxanne Shant\u00e9 is only good for steady serving"

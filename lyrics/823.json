        "\nI'm beginning to feel like a black God (black God)\nGod cipher divine is what it stands for (Stands For)\nNow who think their bars are equal to match ours? (Match Ours)\nI think you're way overrated, your shit ain't that hard (That Hard)\n\n\nBut for me to run up with them shooters would be a bad scene\nI'm from the back blocks where they clap rockets\nI'm the king of New York\nAnd that pap blockin\nGot a mac cocked, ain't no slap boxin'\nThey had B.I.G. in a bigger coffin, ever since Dave Dinkins was still in office, with everybody hatin killin office (fuck that)\nMomma should of had a quick abortion\nBut as soon as they start reachin more shells\nCritical, pull a fourfifth pull a forfeit this ziggity  >???<\nYou don't really wanna slip into it cuz Pap is a tragedy\nThat's backwards strap in the back of the Cadillac\nBlack click clack blasting the mac naturally\nPap bang mines I present this critical rap attached what?\nWhile I'm mastering that, it's really fatal, I rock your motherfuckin cradle\nAnd go take a nap with a bunch of maggots\nAnd you'll have to relax but in real life it was high cronic I was puffing bag after bag that's a fact\nHow could he not go all I shoot is teflons 40 calibers gats\nRappers a bragging enough I'm serious, but he's actually trash\nHe crabbed to me i cracked his crash\nFeel the rap for your majesty\nI create so rapidly fast\n\n\n\nI'm beginning to feel like a black God (Black God)\nGod cipher divine is what it stands for (Stands For)\nNow who think their bars are equal to match ours? (Match Ours)\nI'm so underrated I am the Black God (Black God)\n\n\nEverybody want to be in a precinct\nThey snitching, its sad to see they way raps are\nCome move with the movement, drop jewels and remove the confusion\nEverybody wanna use an illusion, spit a verse from the bad boy, did nothing but use and abuse him (Biggie!)\nMC's be fakin', it's proven, I'm crussin' cos I'm shooting\nJump in a vehicle and bust a nine!\nWho wrote the Blueprint?\nMe? I'm a product of Malcolm X Willie Lynch, no not him\nW.E.B. Dubois, Free O. J., Rest in peace to Johnnie Cochran\nWe ride it enough today\nShow up, Show \u2018nough, we define the definition\nOf the words \u201cBe Free\u201d, these suckas tellin\u2019 us to fuckin lock and\nLoad all them thangs, even though I fought with the works\nI\u2019m cursed with all the blame, homie all the blame I be gettin\nMake me wanna go just shit on you lames, ain\u2019t toilet trained\nYou maggots all the same, \u2018till i cock and pop that thang\nStraight aimin\u2019, ain\u2019t hittin' you off of mistaken\nAK lookin' boy, home boy done came around the same town ???\nPut a stamp on it, when a dope fiend die from it\nEverybody say he got the best of the boy\nShoot like an AK, that boy don\u2019t play, remix ery'day lookin boy\nDon\u2019t get it fucked up, facts with the facts\nWitcha' favorite flow from the cradle to the grave, lookin' boy\nYou playin', lookin boy?

Ya' rap style is replaceable\nI always win the race, lookin' boy\n\n\n\nI'm beginning to feel like a black God (Black God)\nGod cipher divine is what it stands for (Stands For)\nNow who think their bars are equal to match ours? (Match Ours)\nThe way I'm rotting on this track call me jaguar (Jaguar)\nMan when the reals involved your mans get gripped on and clapped on\n\n\n\nSee, you don\u2019t smoke what I be smokin', No homie, it\u2019s highly potent\nLeave ya' whole body broken, your casket is finally closin'\nAnd I do not be chokin'\nWhen i toss the lead straight out the picture with these\nRhymes I wrote'em.

So that boy went straight to the radio station the very next week\n\u201cHey Pap, it\u2019s comical\"\nCritics I'mma blast you while using knowledge and speed\nMicro Machine\nSome of you ain\u2019t doin nothing, you a sucka\u2019 i be shootin'\nBucking at ya' crew and now I rule you-you-you-you\nI\u2019m renovatin' and I made it right so everything I say is articulating\n\u2018till the tinger hits a funeral\nRegulating rolling never speculating\nTime to get the motherfucking glory, all the imitators imitating\nGenerating and I know the fakers are forever faking\nWanna see an artist take my headoff, they be hella' hating\n\u2018Cause I know the way to get'em all creating\nPut a nickel plate and use it, you just hesitate to use it\n\"Oh, he ain\u2019t the real king\"\nThat\u2019s what they say when they be stuck in that illusion\nKick rocks, ya\u2019 album flip flop\nYo trash wasn\u2019t selling you a true bitch\nCrip Glocks, cock back quick shots\nThey be drops that you never could improve in\n\"I don\u2019t know how to make bars like that, that boy just hurts the booth\"\nLemme know when you got the urge to move\nWills put you in a herse when they squirt through the roof\nThristy, i\u2019m an immerker, you twerking dudes\nProve that if you could fathom right from wrong, you could master life\u2019s purpose to all\nYou dummies, real funny, but look at the path I laid\nYou still from me, pulling my wealth. You still bore me\nDon\u2019t lie to yourself with them hateful rules\nElevate your mind fool \u2018cause I\nStill study, I\u2019m gully. Ill when I spit my tongue\nI just spit in your face and say \"fuck you\"\nPunk, you hating and i\u2019m so fucking real\nI\u2019m launching a log, you blaming the industry, kill that noise\nBush ruined the country. But straight ahead\u2019s something that's\nGetting ugly for money. Soldiers fight with rebels and\nHere\u2019s what is becoming\nCatastrophe obliviates our living space, and it\u2019s a state of elimination\nFull of hate from the paths to disgrace. Our generation of kids\nPathetic. Say it\u2019s liberation, but they plan is to kill a nation\nBut fuck it, you afraid of the gimicks? Blaze at the fake then\nBut if I can\u2019t shatter they image\nHow the fuck am I supposed to face all the racists?\nDon\u2019t debate, that is hating cause I\u2019m able to straight take\nThe fore train of bowl and green and erase all they wages, they living large\nAnd take that cape from the majors, don\u2019t be a facade\nWooden king? Think hard, Pap the king. Peace to the Gods"

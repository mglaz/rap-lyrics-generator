(Eternal life and forever)\nAnd will I be the G that I was?\n(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of\nSo relax your soul, let me take control\nClose your eyes my son) my eyes are closed\n\n\nMurder\nMurder was the case that they gave me\nMurder\nMurder was the case that they gave me\n\n\nI'm fresh up out my coma\nI got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner\nIt's gonna take a miracle they say\nFor me to walk again and talk again but anyway\nI get fronted some keys to get back on my feet\nAnd everything that nigga said came to reality\nLiving like a baller loc\nHaving money and blowing hella chronic smoke\nI bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag\nAnd now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rag\n(Just remember who changed your mind\nCause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)\nIndeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed\nNever have a want, never have a need\nThey say I'm greedy but I still want mo'\nCuz my eyes wanna journey some mo', really doe (check it out)\n\n\nNow I lay me down to sleep\nI pray the Lord, my soul to keep\nIf I should die, before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul to take\n\n\nNo more indo, gin and juice\nI'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose\nShackled from head to toe\nTwenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know\nThem niggas from the other side recognize my face\nCause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C\nMad dogging niggas cause I don't care\nRed jumpsuit with two braids in my hair\nNiggas stare as I enter the center\nThey send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay\nLate night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor\nNiggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off\nCause you can't tell what's next\nMy little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck\nAnd he probably won't make it to see twenty-two\nI put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo\n\n\nMurder\nMurder was the case that they gave me\nMurder\nMurder was the case that they gave me"

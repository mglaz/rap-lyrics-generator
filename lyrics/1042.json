        "\nLadies listen up, I really hope you're ready\nCause what I've got to say is far from petty\nWe've come a long way, baby, so maybe\nShant\u00e9 can help a sister that's way be-\n-hind, lost in the mind and can't find\nHer way to a better day, you know the kind\nSo wrapped up in fairy tale dreams\nSo naive that every male seems\nHonest and loyal, ready to spoil\nBuying him gifts as if the boy's loyal\nBut Shant\u00e9 is here just to say a few things\nSome you heard before, but some are new things\n\n\nSo lend me your ears, dry up your tears\nAnd let's hear the cheers for the years\nOf the independent woman\n\n\n(Yeah)\n(Louder)\n\n\nHow many runny-nose kids can you have?\nHow many nights can you work on the ave.?\nYour so-called man has a car and a Visa\nHe's living large while you're living on pizza\nUnemployed while you wait for the perfect mate\nLet's get one thing straight cause it's getting late\nWhat you're waiting for is really never coming\nNo one hears the sorry tunes that you're humming\nI'm here to bring the news, that if you're singing the blues\nEveryday, it will not change the views\nThat people have of you, they say you're lost\nNobody forced you to quit, your future's tossed\nYou put your faith in the guys with the hazel eyes\nYou thought you would get a prize, all you got was lies\nNow you're stuck in a room with a mopping broom\nDid you assume that one day you will find a groom?\nAre you dizzy? Who would ever marry you?\nYou're looking for a man that will carry you\nAnd buy you nice things, like diamond rings\nYou're amazed at the truth that my rhyming brings\nBut the truth is the only way you'll ever see\nThat the life that you're hoping for will never be\nBut the race isn't over, put down the rope\nShant\u00e9 is here to say there's still hope\n\n\nSo lend me your ears, dry up your tears\nAnd let's hear the cheers for the years\nOf the independent woman\n\n\n(Yeah)\n(Louder)\n\n\nSo much to live for, she wants to die\nLife's full of pitfalls, maybe that's why\nHer pops went to jail, her mother tapped her vein\nCity took custody and trapped her in pain\nFeeling so alone in the room with a stranger\nHates her own blood and nothing's gonna change her\nAngry at the world cause it doesn't play fair\nSo much despair does she feel, no one to care\nNot a single family member will remember her\nSmoke's in her eyes, and the past is a blur\nShe's on her own now, living with some other girls\nWith the same damn lives, but from a different world\nThese girls are lost, how the city is full of fools\nSo many years, no guidings, and no kinda rules\nNo love to give, yo, they need love to live\nIf not instead, they'll ponder in a bed\nSex is the thing that makes her feel wanted\nLove and care, for she's undaunted\nBecause whoever is laying there won't really matter\nSuch a sad song when young dreams shatter\nI really don't think glue is gonna fix it\nBut homegirl can walk the right path if she picks it\n\n\nSo lend me your ears, dry up your tears\nAnd let's hear the cheers for the years\nOf the independent woman\n\n\n(Yeah)\n(Louder)\n\n\nThe black woman role grows larger each day\nNothing in the way so what we teach may\nSomehow help those young sisters that doze\nAnd sleepwalk through life with their eyes closed\nYou don't need a man, all you need is to know you can\nThen you can stand on your own two feet and\nAchieve anything that you want out of life\nDo for yourself, then you can be a wife\nAnd you'll feel so good that you wanna shout\nBecause you got to the top and got there without\nRelying on Tom, Dick, or Billy Dee\nYou don't have to turn the lights on to really see\n\n\nSo lend me your ears, dry up your tears\nAnd let's hear the cheers for the years\nOf the independent woman"

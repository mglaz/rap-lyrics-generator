        "\nShe mix the red and white wine like the Catalina (She do it)\nYou call her a stripper, that's my ballerina (Oh God)\nSee that's your stage but it's my arena (She mine)\nThat's not a stripper, that's my ballerina (Hold up)\n\n\nLet me see you dance for me, dance, dance, dance\nDo a handstand for me, dance, dance, dance (She do it)\nBaby can you pop it for me? Dance, dance, dance\nLet me see you drop it for me, dance, dance, dance\n\n\nI said\nOh I'm takin' heavy, bring that big scale\nI'd say don't ride my wave but that ship sailed (Do it!)\nMan my dog still riding with that fish scale\nDoing fishtails like he really miss jail\nI got that sauce, got that marinara (sauce)\nTalking hoes, I've had my fair share of (hoes)\nShe pulled up on me in that Panamera (yeah)\nThick white bitch look like Aguilera\n\n\nShe mix the red and white wine like the Catalina (She do it)\nYou call her a stripper, that's my ballerina (Oh God)\nSee that's your stage but it's my arena (She mine)\nThat's not a stripper, that's my ballerina (Hold up)\n\n\nLet me see you dance for me, dance, dance, dance\nDo a handstand for me, dance, dance, dance (She do it)\nBaby can you pop it for me? Dance, dance, dance\nLet me see you drop it for me, dance, dance, dance\n(Drop it, drop it, drop it)\n\n\nOh you playing but I got the cheat code (Yeah)\nShallow bitches always got the deep quotes (Do it!)\nThe block is hot but the streets cold (Yeah)\nShoes designer but she got a cheap soul, oh\nI drop the top on that Maranello\nBig suitcases like we play the cello\nSleeping on me, get a bigger pillow\nLive fast, die young just like Barrichello\n\n\nShe mix the red and white wine like the Catalina (She do it)\nYou call her a stripper, that's my ballerina (Oh God)\nSee that's your stage but it's my arena (She mine)\nThat's not a stripper, that's my ballerina (Hold up)\n\n\nLet me see you dance for me, dance, dance, dance\nDo a handstand for me, dance, dance, dance (She do it)\nBaby can you pop it for me?

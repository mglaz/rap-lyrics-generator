        "\nOh, yeah\nOh, yeah\nOh, yeah\nOoh\n\n\nI think I love you\nBut don't let me get in the way (Get in the way)\nDon't let me stop you girl\nFrom doing your thing (Doing your thing)\n'Cause I don't deserve you, no\nI don't want to hurt you\nPlay with your mind\nHave you running in circles, yeah\nDon't let me get in your way (Get in your way)\n\n\nIt ain't even the puss' I got your mind\nIt's usually a one way thing but baby girl got mine\nPerfection is the formula when me and her combine\nLike candy to the corn and yeah you're finger-licking fine\nIn due time I'm sure that I can please you, squeeze you, weak knees you\nNeed you like you need me, and don't mislead you\nLove's free but treat it wrong and pay the price\nGet down on one knee, that bitch gon' leave with half your life\nMan believe me, I ain't gon' feed you bad advice\nLook it's easy, so don't forget to strap up tight\nRide, I'd be selfish if I kept you so (So)\nI love you enough to let you go (Go)\nCause on the other hand I couldn't take it if I\nPut all I got in you and someone got you naked\nYou work hard for money but it's harder when you make it\nThese chicks coming fast, here's your heart before I break it; take it\n\n\nI think I love you\nDon't let me get in the way (Get in the way)\nDon't let me stop you girl\nFrom doing your thing (Doing your thing)\n'Cause I don't deserve you, no\nI don't want to hurt you\nPlay with your mind\nHave you running in circles\nDon't let me get in your way (Get in your way)\n\n\nWhat type of nigga would I be to hold you up?\nYou need someone to hold you down\nAnd recognize your life's fucked up\nI got to shake you out my system\n'Cause with the fucking and kissing\nAnd all your emotions mixed in puts me in a tough position\nBaby, what am I supposed to do?\nI can't control my actions when I'm close to you\nWe been away too long girl we're overdue\nI guess the cake ain't enough you want to eat it too\nSee me and you have a magnet in between that keeps pulling me closer\nI'm like an addict for your scream, your fully loaded toast\nAutomatic with the beam, the baddest on the coast\nI got to have you like the green, your swag is more than most\nI got a sex drive that won't allow me to lax\nBring on the next five, look how they grind on my lap\nBooty, breast, thighs keep your boy relaxed in back\nAnd you deserve way more than that, I'll just fall back\n\n\nI think I love you\nDon't let me get in the way (Get in the way)\nDon't let me stop you girl\nFrom doing your thing (Doing your thing)\n'Cause I don't deserve you, no, no\nI don't want to hurt you\nPlay with your mind (Play with your mind)\nHave you running in circles\nDon't let me get in your way (Get in your way)\n\n\nI've been thinking a long time\nAnd wishing you were just all mine\nSo maybe this is the wrong time\nThat I deserve it, I don't deserve it\nI've been thinking a long time\nAnd wishing you were just all mine\nSo maybe this is the wrong time\nThat I deserve it, I don't deserve it, no\nI don't deserve it, I don't deserve it\nI don't deserve it, I don't deserve it\nI don't deserve it, I don't deserve it\nI don't deserve it, I don't deserve it"

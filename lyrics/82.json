        "\n\n\nHuman beings in a mob\nWhat's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?\nWhat's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?\nWill he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild\n\n\nTears on the mausoleum floor\nBlood stains the Colosseum doors\nLies on the lips of a priest\nThanksgiving disguised as a feast\nRolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche\nOnly the doctors got this, I\u2019m hiding from police\nCocaine seats\nAll white like I got the whole thing bleached\nDrug dealer chic\nI\u2019m wondering if a thug\u2019s prayers reach\nIs Pious pious 'cause God loves pious?\nSocrates asked, whose bias do y'all seek?\nAll for Plato, screech\nI\u2019m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks\nJesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats\nHova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats\nPreach\n\n\nHuman beings in a mob\nWhat's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?\nWhat's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?\nWill he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild\n\n\nI live by you, desire\nI stand by you, walk through the fire\nYour love is my scripture\nLet me in through your encryption\nYeah, yeah\n\n\nCoke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra\nI call that jungle fever\nYou will not control the threesome\nJust roll the weed up until I get me some\nWe formed a new religion\nNo sins as long as there\u2019s permission\nAnd deception is the only felony\nSo never fuck nobody without telling me\nSunglasses and Advil\nLast night was mad real\nSun coming up, 5 a.m\nI wonder if they got cabs still\nThinking 'bout the girl in all leopard\nWho was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard\nTwo tattoos: one read \"No Apologies\"\nThe other said \"Love is Cursed by Monogamy\"\nIt\u2019s something that the pastor don\u2019t preach\nIt\u2019s something that a teacher can\u2019t teach\nWhen we die, the money we can\u2019t keep\nBut we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain\u2019t cheap\nPreach\n\n\nHuman beings in a mob\nWhat's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?\nWhat's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?\nWill he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild\n\n\nNo church in the wild\nNo church in the wild\nNo church in the wild"

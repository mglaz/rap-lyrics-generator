Swoosh sign, do it\nMy new bitch a nudist, peace like a buddist\nCooler than Cool Whip, give brain, don't be stupid\nFaded like Boosie, cut like a crew neck\nArm out the window, 'nother check, 'nother Rolex\nMo' less, the Moet, the mo' sex, I must say\nI boarded the P-jet, more than a piss test\nSo wake up, I'm fucked up, my ex tryna make up\n\n\nBreak up, telling these bitches to get their cake up\nWake up, shooting my babies all on her make-up\nI'm running through these hoes, Brandon Jacobs\nLambo doors up, sitting just like her legs\nSkeeted off from the club, rather fuck hoes instead\n\n\nUhh, when I switch lanes, Phantom doors swing\nArm out the window screaming \"Money ain't a thang\"\nCall it automatic bang, bang, bang\nCall it automatic bang, bang, bang\nRari switch lanes, diamonds in my chain\nBeen around the world, all the hoes know my name\nCall it automatic bang, bang, bang\nMiss that automatic bang, bang, bang\n\n\nNever tell a bitch I love her, money talk, Chris Tucker\nGot a chauffeur and a driver, I don't lease it, I'ma buy it\nY'all be on a broke diet, you ain't eating but you biting my style\nMotherfucker strike like lightning\nT-Carti, my bitch like Bvlgari\nI walk in the spot, all the bitches bogart me\nSpent 30 racks, I'ma make it back tomorrow\nPull up with a big titty bitch like Toccara\n\n\nYou ain't never seen a rari, look like a safari\nTyga riding shotgun, snake print Carti-er\nI'm in them Nike Airs\n2500 nigga, call them Nikes rare\nSee them niggas hating, but I don't really care\nGold bottles coming, tell them bitches light flares\nSnow on my wirst call that Roley big bear\nNigga see it in the light though (woo!)

        "\nPlain Pat, what up?\n\n\nMy heart thump\nNot from being nervous\nSometimes I'm thinking God\nMade me special here on purpose\nSo all the while, 'til I'm gone\nMake my words important\nSo if I slip away, if I die today\nThe last thing you remember won't be\nAbout some apple bottom jeans\nWith the boots with the fur\nMaybe how I dream of being free since my birth\nCursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse\nHave you ever heard of some shit so real\nBeyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel\n\n\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul, to take\nBut please don't cry\nJust know that I have made these songs for you\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul, to take\n'Cause I'm ready for the funeral\n\n\nMy mind runs\nI could never catch it\nEven if I got a head start\nGod please help me\nI am feeling so alone, wait\nI don't need to worry\n'Cause I know the world'll feel this, nigga\nBlessing in disguise, but\nI am not hiding who I am, open your eyes, bruh\nIf I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo\nGirls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo\nUnless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho\nThe shit is so ill\nPlay it back from the top if you recognize real\n\n\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul, to take\nBut please don't cry\nJust know that I have made these songs for you\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul, to take\n'Cause I'm ready for the funeral\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul, to take\nBut please don't cry\nJust know that I have made these songs for you\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul, to take\n'Cause I'm ready for the funeral\n\n\nI'm ready for that\nI'm ready for the funeral, hey-hey\nI'm ready for the funeral, hey\nI'm ready for the funeral\nHey, I'm ready for it\nI'm ready for it\nI'm ready for the funeral"

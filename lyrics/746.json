        "\nDon\u2019t it seem like\nLike I\u2019m always there when it matters\nBut missing most of the other time\nA terrible pattern\nThe rewards I see from working\nMade me an addict\nThere's way more people that want it\nThan people that have it\nI don't get it, I would hate to think I tricked \u2018em\nThey fall victim to my system\nGuess I sure know how to pick em\nAnd I\u2019m always her regret\nYeah, I\u2019m always her regret\nAnd I always make it harder on whoever\u2019s coming next\nIt goes up and down, it\u2019s just up and down\nShe\u2019s crying now but she\u2019ll laugh again\nCause we on the rise and she here with us\nAnd expensive shit, just keeps happening\nShe loves it, she stares at me like who does this\nAnd we hold hands while I pray that she\u2019s not the type to hold grudges\nI\u2019m wrong..\n\n\nBad boys ain't no good\nGood boys ain't no fun\nLord knows that I should\nRun off with the right one\n\n\nMe and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)\nEven though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)\nWe got a special thing going on\nMe and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)\nEven if I try, no, I never could\nGive him up cause his loves like that\nAin't no way that I\u2019m moving on\nI love my Mr. Wrong\n\n\nHung up off your good\nYou call and I run\nMy fam' is screaming at me don\u2019t do it\n\"Don't do it, Mary!\"\nI guess they never had none\n\n\nMe and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)\nEven though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)\nWe got a special thing going on(going on)\nMe and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)\nEven if I try, no, I never could\nGive him up cause his loves like that\nAin't no way that I\u2019m moving on\nI love my Mr. Wrong\n\n\nWhen he put that loving on me, I can\u2019t think of nothing\nThat\u2019ll make me walk out\nI\u2019m holding on\nI love my Mr. Wrong\nHe be kissing and touching on me\nI can\u2019t help but love him\nI must be out my mind\nFor going so strong\nI love my Mr. Wrong\nMr. Wrong\n\n\nMe and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)\nEven though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)\nWe got a special thing going on(going on)\nMe and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)\nEven if I try, no, I never could (I never could)\nGive him up cause his loves like that\nAin't no way that I\u2019m moving on\nI love my Mr. Wrong\n\n\nMr. Wrong"

        "\nMy motto is: Chicago, bitch\nEverybody know you sweet, what the problem is\nDon\u2019t play dumb, I\u2019m the one that acknowledged it\nSon of a bitch, I imagine what your father is\nShe said, \u201cHow you make your opponent\nThe rapper of the moment?\u201d His style, he don\u2019t own it\nActing all hard when he hardly like that\nYou gon\u2019 mess around and make me catch a body like that\nAwwww, don\u2019t do it\nCause every song you make, Joe, is really ho music\nI heard you said you wasn\u2019t a bitch because you sing\nYou a bitch because you cling like a bitch that\u2019s eighteen\nCan\u2019t say my name but rap about a nigga\u2019s wife\nYou so black and white, trying to live a nigga\u2019s life\nI\u2019m taking too long with this amateur guy\nYou ain\u2019t wet nobody, nigga, you Canada dry\n\n\nSoft nigga. Make no mistake, I\u2019m talking to Drake\nIt\u2019s the remix. Rick Ross, Common, and that ho-ass nigga\nNo, man-to-man, don\u2019t hide behind them other niggas\nNah, this man-to-man. You can\u2019t run behind them man\nThis is some real man shit right here\n\n\nSay my name, say my name\nIf no one is around you\nIf you ain't running game\nSay my name, say my name\nYou acting kinda shady\nWhy the sudden change?\nSay my name, say my name\nIf no one is around you\nIf you ain\u2019t running game\nSay my name, say my name\nYou acting kinda shady\nBetter say my name"

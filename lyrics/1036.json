        "\n\nI met this girl when I was about ten\nI used to love her but we still friends\nHer name was Roxanne, Shantae to be exact\nGirl flyer than the UTFO\nI seen her at the play park\nHer and her homegirls rockin they bamboos\nAnd ad-di-das suits\nPlus they had shell-toes and they Gazelles too\nWish I was grow'd up and they aged too\nI wish I could afford them thangs that the older dudes wore\nThen maybe she would notice me\nCold Chillin' on the Sugar Hill along with my gang\n\n\n\nOoh, when I first laid eyes on you girl\nI knew I had to make you mine\nAnd even though its been so long girl\nYou know that you stay on my mind\nSo come along and take my hand girl\nAnd we can stand the test of time\nI still love you\nI still love you-u-u\n\n\n\nYou know what\nFor five years I was staked out in front of her crib\nJust to prove to Roxanne that my love was real\nBut it seemed every time I  would often feel\nTo a woman of her caliber\nI won't appeal\nTo? Maybe\nPlease Roxanne, Baby, won't you be my baby\nAnd stop avoiding me like I'm some mutt with rabies\nSome say she fuck with Dr. Ice, The Educated Rapper, and The Kangol Kid\nThen reality started to kick in\nI was just a kid and that began to sink in, sink in, sink in\nI still have room to grow to show the world how much love I got for you fo sho'\n\n\n\nOoh, when I first laid eyes on you girl\nI knew I had to make you mine\nAnd even though its been so long girl\nYou know that you stay on my mind\nSo come along and take my hand girl\nAnd we can stand the test of time\nI still love you\nI still love you-u-u"

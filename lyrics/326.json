        "\nMy anaconda don't, my anaconda don't\nMy anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun\n\n\nBoy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit\nBi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins\nWas in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace\nBo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish\nNow that's real, real, real\nGun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill\nWho wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils\nI'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill\nI'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?\nHe can tell I ain't missing no meals\nCome through and fuck him in my automobile\nLet him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill\nAnd he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal\nSay he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab\nSo I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like\nDun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun\n\n\nMy anaconda don't, my anaconda don't\nMy anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun\n\n\nOh my gosh, look at her butt\nOh my gosh, look at her butt (I-ohhaha)\nOh my gosh, look at her butt\n(Look at her butt)\nLook at, look at, look at\nLook at her butt\n\n\nThi-this dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles\nDi-dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's\nReal country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle\nPussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil\nNow that bang, bang, bang\nI let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine\nHe toss my salad like his name Romaine\nAnd when we done, I make him buy me Balmain\nI'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?\nHe can tell I ain't missing no meals\nCome through and fuck him in my automobile\nLet him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill\nAnd he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal\nHe say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab\nSo I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like\nDun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun...\n\n\nMy anaconda don't, my anaconda don't\nMy anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun\n\n\nOh my gosh, look at her butt\nOh my gosh, look at her butt (I-ohhaha)\nOh my gosh, look at her butt\n(Look at her butt)\nLook at, look at, look at\nLook at her butt\n\n\nLittle in the middle but she got much back\nLittle in the middle but she got much back\nLittle in the middle but she got much back\n(Oh my God, look at my butt)\n\n\nMy anaconda don't, my anaconda don't\nMy anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun\n(Do-don't) My anaconda don't (Don't)\n(Do-don't) want none unless you got buns, hun\n\n\nOh my gosh, look at her butt\n(Little in the middle but she got much back)\nOh my gosh, look at her butt\n(Little in the middle but she got much back)\nOh my gosh, look at her butt\n(Little in the middle but she got much back)\n(Look at her butt)\nLook at, look at, look at\nLook at her butt\n\n\nYeah, he love this fat ass, hahahahahahahaha!\nYeah!

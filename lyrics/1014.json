        "\nI hope that God decides to talk through him\nThat the people decide to walk with him\nRegardless of Pitchfork, cosigns I've jumped\nMake sure the soundman doesn't cockblock the drums\nLet the snare knock the air right outta your lungs\nAnd those words be the oxygen\nJust breathe\nAmen, regardless I'ma say it\nFelt like I got signed the day that I got an agent\nGot an iTunes check, shit man I'm paying rent\n'Bout damn time that I got out of my basement\n'Bout damn time I got around the country and I hit these stages\nI was made to slay them\nTen thousand hours\nI'm so damn close I can taste it\nOn some Malcolm Gladwell\nDavid-Bowie-meets-Kanye shit\nThis is dedication\nA life lived for art is never a life wasted\nTen thousand\n\n\nTen thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands\nTen thousand hands, they carry me\nTen thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands\nTen thousand hands, they carry me\n\n\nNow, now, now\nThis is my world, this is my arena\nThe TV told me something different I didn't believe it\nI stand here in front of you today, all because of an idea\nI could be who I wanted if I could see my potential\nAnd I know that one day I'ma be him\nPut the gloves on, sparring with my ego\nEveryone's greatest obstacle, I beat him\nCelebrate that achievement\nGot some attachments, some baggage, I'm actually working on leaving, see\nI observed Escher\nI love Basquiat\nI watched Keith Haring\nYou see I study art\nThe greats weren't great because at birth they could paint\nThe greats were great because they'd paint a lot\nI will not be a statistic, just let me be\nNo Child Left Behind, that's the American scheme\nI make my living off of words\nAnd do what I love for work\nAnd got around 980 on my SATs\nTake that system\nWhat you expect?\nGeneration of kids choosing love over a desk\nPut those hours in, and look at what you get\nNothing that you can hold, but everything that it is\nTen thousand\n\n\nTen thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands\nTen thousand hands, they carry me\nTen thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands\nTen thousand hands, they carry me\n\n\nSame shit, different day, same struggle\nSlow motion as time slips through my knuckles\nNothing beautiful about it\nNo light at the tunnel\nFor the people that put the passion before them being comfortable\nRaw, unmedicated heart, no substitute\nBanging on table tops, no subs to toot\nI'm feeling better than ever, man what is up with you?\nScraping my knuckles, I'm battling with some drug abuse\nI lost another friend, got another call from a sister\nAnd I speak for the people that share that struggle too\nLike they got something bruised\nMy only rehabilitation was the sweat, tears and blood when up in the booth\n\n\nIt's the part of the show where it all fades away\nWhen the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage\nAnd you wanted a encore but there's no encore today\n'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave\nPart of the show, it all fades away\nLights go to black, band leaves the stage\nYou wanted a encore but there's no encore today\n'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave\n\n\nWelcome to the Heist\nWelcome to the Heist\nWelcome to the Heist\nWelcome to the Heist\nWelcome to the Heist\nWelcome to the Heist"

        "\n\"What'd you do last night?\"\n\"We did, umm, two whole cars\nIt was me, Dez, and Mean Three, right?\nAnd on the first car in small letters it said\n'All you see is\u2026' and then, you know\nBig, big, you know, some block silver letters\nThat said 'crime in the city', right?\"\n\"It just took up the whole car?\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, it was a whole car and shit...\"\nEsc\u00fachela, la ciudad respirando\nEsc\u00fachela, la ciudad respirando\nEsc\u00fachela, la ciudad respirando\nEsc\u00fachela...\n\n\nThe new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis\nShinin', like \"Who on top of this?\"\nPeople was tusslin', arguin' and bustlin'\nGangstas of Gotham hardcore hustlin'\nI'm wrestlin' with words and ideas\nMy ears is pricked, seekin' what will transmit\nThe scribes can apply to transcript\nYo, this ain't no time where the usual is suitable\nTonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable, the indisputable (What?)\nWe New York, the narcotics\nDraped in metal and fiber optics\nWhere mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips for profits\nThirsty criminals pick pockets\nHard knuckles on the second hands of working-class watches\nSkyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living is preposterous\nStay alive, you pay or die, no options\nNo Batman and Robin\nCan't tell between the cops and the robbers\nThey both partners, they all heartless, with no conscience\nBack streets stay darkened where unbeliever hearts stay hardened\nMy eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbin'\nYou either make your way or stay sobbin'\nThe shiny Apple is bruised, but sweet\nAnd if you choose to eat, you could lose your teeth\nMany crews retreat\nNightly news repeat who got shot down and locked down\nSpotlight the savages, NASDAQ averages\nMy narrative grows to explain this existence\nAmidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance\n\n\nSo much on my mind that I can't recline\nBlastin' holes in the night 'til she bled sunshine\nBreathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine\nBreathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline\nHeard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call\nI can't take it, y'all, I can feel the city breathin'\nChest heavin', against the flesh of the evenin'\nSigh before we die like the last train leavin'\n\n\nBreathin' in deep city breaths, sittin' on shitty steps\nWe stoop to new lows, Hell froze the night the city slept\nThe Beast crept through concrete jungles\nCommunicatin' with one another\nAnd ghetto birds where waters fall\nFrom the hydrants to the gutters\nThe Beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin'\nYou on the wrong side of the track, lookin' visibly shaken\nTakin' them plungers\nPlungin' to death that's painted by the numbers\nWith Krylon applied pressure; cats is playin' God\nBut havin' children by a lesser baby mother, but fuck it\nWe played against each other like puppets, swearin' you got pull\nWhen the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes\nGettin' knowledge in jail like a blessin' in disguise\nLook in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog\nIs broken dreams flyin' away on the wings of the obscene\nThoughts that people put in the air\nPlaces where you could get murdered over a glare\nBut everything is fair\nIt's a paradox we call reality\nSo keepin' it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality\nKillers Born Naturally, like Mickey and Mallory\nNot knowin' the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary\nSome cats be emceein' to illustrate what we be seein'\nHard to be a spiritual being\nWhen shit is shakin' what you believe in\nFor trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted\nI'm askin' if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded\nMy blood pressure boiled and rose\n'Cause New York niggas actin' spoiled at shows\nTo the winners, the spoils go\nI take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates\nNew York life type trife, the Roman Empire state\n\n\nSo much on my mind, I just can't recline\nBlastin' holes in the night till she bled sunshine\nBreathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine\nBreathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline\nYo, don't the bass ride out like an ancient mating call? I can't\nTake it, y'all, I can feel the city breathing\nChest heaving, against the flesh of the evening\nSigh before we die like the last train leaving\n\n\n\u00a1Escuchela... Respirando como yo\u2026 Ojos sinceros, escondiendo pena y temor\u2026 El silencio de mentira, tocando al hogar escapando sentimientos entre ella y yo\u2026\n\n\nYo, on The Amen\nCorner I stood lookin' at my former hood\nFelt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good\nThrew dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it\nMixin' down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered\nI choreograph seven steps to Heaven\nIn Hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leaven\nVeteran of a cold war; it's Chica-I-go for\nWhat I know or what's known\nSo some days I take the bus home, just to touch home\nFrom the crib I spend months gone, sat by the window\nWith a clutched dome listening to shorties cuss long\nYoung girls with weak minds, but they butt strong\nTried to call, or at least beep the Lord but didn't have a touch-tone\nIt's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on\nSome of this land I must own, outta the city, they want us gone\nTearing down the 'jects creating plush homes\nMy circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones\nSurrounded by hate, yet I love home\nAsk my guy how he thought travelling the world sound\nFound it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown\nIt's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep\nOf reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep\nDeep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep\nOf reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep\n\n\nSo much on my mind, I just can't recline\nBlastin' holes in the night till she bled sunshine\nBreathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine\nBreathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline\nYo, how the bass ride out like an ancient mating call? I can't\nTake it, y'all, I can feel the city breathing\nChest heaving, against the flesh of the evening\nKiss the odds goodbye, I'm on the last train leaving"

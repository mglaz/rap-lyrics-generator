        "\nI know you want this for life\nTaking pictures with all my ice\nBut I can't have no wife\nI just want you for the night\nI know you want this for life\nTaking pictures with all my ice\nBut I can't have no wife\nI just want you for the night (just for the night)\n\n\nI know you want this for life\nFuck you so good you be calling out the Christ (oh my God)\nBottles of the Tech got it laid on ice\nWe spent four seasons at the Four Seasons twice\nYou be calling all your homegirls like \"I'm his wife\"\nHell nah, you trippin', reevaluate your life\nI can't love no bitch, every single hoe is trife\nI sip dirty Sprite just to get me through the night\nBut I need you there (I need you there)\nPromise that I need you there\nAin't no other bitch gon' fuck me like you do, I swear\nPut that on my gang I swear\nI just can't put you on front street like you want I know\nBut baby you is not no hoe\nAnd I put it on my gang I'm not no average joe (average joe)\nIt's Yachty from the block you know\n\n\nI know you want this for life\nTaking pictures with all my ice\nBut I can't have no wife\nI just want you for the night\nI know you want this for life\nTaking pictures with all my ice\nBut I can't have no wife\nI just want you for the night"

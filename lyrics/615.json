        "\nAfter filling my reputation of whore beaters\nSoared to Taco Bell and I ordered some gorditas (Mmm, that's good!)\nWanted four more, ordered 'em, didn't eat 'em\nThen head to Thebe's house for some gymnastics\nFantastic, I backflip on this beat, B\nCause we running shit like the Dingleberries on four cheetahs\nFlow colder than Papa Joe's, old Domino's\nFuck it, whatever\nUm... Trashwang scratched inside the knucks\nGot some One Direction tickets, I should hit that up\nDrive by with puppy signs plastered on the truck\nThen see how many of they fans could fit inside the trunk\nMove over the microwave and the cannabis\nTry to take the van and the whole band to Canada\nFuck the block news and the venues, they can't handle us\nThey can't stand us including fruits that Frank's channeling\nThe Ku Klux Klan see me and my managers\nBut thank me when they ask where the Five Panels is\nMan, I suck now, I ain't still dope\nBut Chris and Rihanna's fuckin' again so there's still hope\nOh fuck, I went there, balling bitch, I'm Ben's hair\nY'all barely breaking like Taco's self-esteem in a thin chair\nOld Navy bitches love this gap, yeah this grin's rare\nWatch a nigga smile like five-year-old child\nI'm kicking it with Nak and the nigga from Green Mile, it's\nRed Bull in this cup so a nigga may seem wild but\nThat's just all the sherm I was burning a little while ago\nDon't let me get hold of that rifle\nShout my nigga Sage Elsseser and Sean Pablo\nSurrounded by them niggas that skate with a sick style\nAnd some freckled bitches with giant peaches that's vile\nThey never did catch that rhino\n\n\nSquadron full of some lost souls\nSergeant of all, it's autumn and Nak just nollied a pothole\nNon-cooperative with his momma's wishes for college\nAnd coppers labeled a  problem since paying for Damianos\nSo shimmy through the swamp, nigga, follow me through the foxholes\nMoral Orenthal with a pretty bitch in a Bronco\nHopped right off the seven and stumbled into some Vatos\nThrew a punch, got jumped, dusted off and then walked home\nShit, it's like 6 P.M. and his temple throbbing\nHand in the cabinet by seven, sniff the prescription oxies\nLogo in the boxes, all my niggas hostile\nCautious of your crosses, scoffing at your doctrines\nBitches augmented, stupid, as the group is, only slightly\nWrite precise to get a pussy nigga tooth chipped\nMan these stitches shut the loose lips, stumbled in a Ruth's Chris\nSlid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips\nSee, Lionel ball with Leonardo on the weekend now\nAnd Maui on a scenic route, we on the second season now\nSmall fry got 'em seasons salty, weeded, coughing\nEase up off me, end is breathing easy as bulimics barfing\nFrom a different breed of doggy, from a different seed and cloth\nAnd teeing off, believe it's Golf Wang, nigga"

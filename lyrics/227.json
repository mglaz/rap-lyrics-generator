        "\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n\n\nStarted blazing, and stargazing\nSee how you can reach your farthest aspirations\nIt's like holy matrimony in the matrix\nIt ain't shit, they just call it a strange shift\nCold feet cause I'm on thin ice\nIt's alright besides the fact I want it all in one night\nLike, you can't skip steps is the best\nEven though the vets hold a .47 with a vest\nNow that's a wise investment\nOr a concept to try and hide divine intentions\nLike, let em hate, stay calm and meditate\nWhen life has the lemons it's time to eliminate\nMore sour than lemonade, anyways\nDifferent days, different highs, different haze\nKama sutra with miss Mary Jane\nAnd the karma suits her, she a vibrant thang\n\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nCause I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n\n\nYou niggas is suspect and I'm just a ruffneck\nThat wasn't breaking pencil tips when I would bust lead\nI puff meds and leave chumps fed and punks dead\nHer cunt wet, she getting rough sex, no sunset\nI like a chick with a buck tooth, yeah it could get fucked too\nWe keep one eye open, they sus too\nNever tell em my government, make any covenant bitches be loving it\nSay not to put a glove on it, some funny shit\nYou must've thought I was a dummy, miss\nI feed lines to felines just to get up in their tummies quick\nYeah you got tricks but I got five more\nSo any game you try to play, you better know I got the high score\nYou better settle down cause you not on my level now\nThe Pros is semi-circle, they can tell the world you get around\nSome niggas clowns, what's the shit about?\nThey used to doubt now they see us sprout and I'm out\n\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nNigga I deserve my respect\nAnd brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n\n\nWhen I was thirteen, I was bad, rapping 'bout guns we never had\nNow we smoke raws with filter tips, old homies talking shit\nSaid you got what's best of mine but you stay plotting on that dime\nThought cause we was cool before that we gon' take yo ass on tour?\nFuck nah, this my chance to get it\nHow you entitled to my shine? Nigga you ain't help me get it\nNow these niggas see me getting it, check the statements on my debit\nMy profile get requested but I never hit \"accept\"\nHit the sour to the chest, I reflect\nWhen I was fourteen, up late, eyes glued to the sampler screen\nEyes beam, cause we can make it better\nSmoking on that Jack Herer, welcome to the Progressive Era\n\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\n\n\nCause I deserve my respect\nAnd brains don't matter but tell me what really matters\nWhen you pissed off at the world like you got a crazy bladder\nAnd, momma always said that shit don't come on silver platters\nSo I gather my thoughts and make use of all these synonyms\nCause I could never swallow the truth, like it's cinnamon\nExcuse me if I'm militant\nThe sinning men in my hood could leave a nigga quivering\nLike goddamn, deliver him, the venom and his liver is\nCorrupting all his ligaments\nNow he's at a standstill so tell me if he'll live again\nThe fire in his heart, still seem to be simmering\nNow take that little simmer and turn it into adrenaline\nPenicillin could not stop the drive he be giving em like mad fours\nBut fast forward, let's get to the part where his records\nCould 'ford him a couple Fords like \"Lord, ain't he gifted?\"\nChristmas just doesn't fit him, I need my own holiday\nAnd by the way, I'mma possibly own Monopoly\nAnd all McDonald's property cause I won't live in poverty like\n\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n\n\nIn the clouds come and find me, someone flier than Hermione\nHomie tripping, got em sounding like Hansen in the nineties\nCharlie Manson your whole body cause that damage in your party\nCan you manage what I'm dishing out? Go get your wishing count\nYou sell me something then I flip that amount\nI just switched that account, get that profit then I'm out\nYeah, they all wonder but it's Nyck bitch don't doubt\nRip your lips off your mouth\nMan I'm violent ring the siren with these bars I'm reciting\nCars with no license\nHard man, I'm feeling like a spartan with a trident\nDamn, picture perfect, bet I'll make that picture worth it\nI'll be doubling my spot, no Louisiana Purchase\nSo declare that, with my hair back\nYou want a fair one, catch a fair smack\nI hunt up on my prey\nSo pray I ain't hunting on your ass today like be afraid\n\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nCause I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n\n\nCool cuts flow, the deli can't touch this\nSlipping like fishes, choking when you hit the cypher\nAnd I ain't talking weed smoke but I let the weed blow\nAnything, just let the leaves know, oh\nSucka's fuck around, get clapped where you rest at\nNigga saying you cracking, fabric of your imagination\nAsk your lady\nIt's assassin when I come up on the track\nIt's a curse that I always try to find sex in these verses\nBut I got your attention, it's part of my ascension\nBut if I keep toking this strain\nIt's gonna leave me stranded in this dimension\nOr to mention, niggas is snitching\nMight charge me with battery\nBut fuck that, cause piss was never in your anatomy\nSo don't try to lie on a nigga that got mine on my third eye shit\n\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nI tell you I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n\n\nMan I'm onto higher degrees without my masters\nI could use my words to urge into disasters\nNiggas wanna know how my wheels keep on spinning\nAnd they see we getting love cause they see the Pros is winning\nCause we giving love back so they peeping how we fitting\nAin't gonna have no sus nigga stepping to me\nI like to keep my chakras open so respect my G\nI got the bush going in, repping FPT\nSo sus niggas watch your back, Pros next to me\nI got Chuck on the team to collect the green\nAnd show these suspect niggas what it mean to scheme\nAnother apex predator crushing your dreams\nGonna get your wig pushed back between my cream\nTaking all you sus niggas, throw you out the scene\nI'm taking all you sus niggas, throwin' out the scene\nTaking all you sus niggas, throw you out the scene\n\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n\n\nThe P, the R, the O, the Dette\nNever am I vexed, I'm always calm, cool, collect\nUnless you disrespect, I wreck you verbally\nSo expect the worst from me, I beck you with my intellect\nYou best be circumspect check, made you making all the wrong moves\nDo I intimidate you, or more infuriate you?\nCause I annihilate all who participating for the gore\nLovers I decapitate with everything I say, see\nCome sneak a peak and, tell me what you peeping\nThen struggle to say it ain't greatness that you seeing\nIt is what here sits in the midst of us, yeah it's quite mysterious\nNo you're not delirious, I'm serious, it's clear to us\nAdd some crystals, gonna see gold\nThen platinum, seen it on some tarots before\nSo I know how it is all gonna go down\nGotta go more uptown, more in the cloud\nCause didn't ya know by now, I'm skyline bound\nAnd my time's now, I don't graze ground, I'm new in your town\nSo assume what you please but you don't know me\nSay what you please but you don't know T'nah\n\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n\n\nWho that mofo that came to showboat just cause he float like no other?\nStyle smooth as butter and slick like lubricant rubbers\nSo going in on tracks ain't a real test, the real quest\nIs making real tracks with feelings people ain't feel yet\nDessy be that suspect for subjects for all the records\nSet in for all the records, I spit in a split of seconds\nSo you can't reckon that I wasn't checking for beats unpleasant\nI eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds\nRemember I'm the face so lace me in the line-up\nThe bars that I could line up could probably bump the fine up\nDefine what never can judge, rap is in my blood\nSo much, my capularies adapted a sanctuary\nFrom the 5th of January, every punchline turned into crunch time\nWas cutting records more times than my school's lunch line\nSo if this hits mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine\nBeen spitting dirty, the vocals recording spit shine\n\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nAnd I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n\n\n'Til the day I die, I'll be puffing lye, fuck the world, fuck it dry\nTell them government spies I won't cover my eyes\nWon't cower, won't move cause I don't move like a coward\nKnowledge is power and the flower of life is ours\nGet as high as ours, maybe you could see the towers\nScour your dirty mind and maybe you unleash the power\nWe all got the potential in our body and soul, probably you know\nI found mines right through the pencil, started bodying flows\nBut fuck that, this be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval\nI hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to squeal\nThis one for my people, headed to the top, no redo\nThinking up evil but see no evil, just be knievel\nCause I ain't ask to be this good, they just made me better\nThey told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar\nAnd the green only made me clever\nSee God made three Bigs, two Pacs, but he only made one error\nThe Era\n\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit"

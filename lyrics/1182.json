Oh\n\n\nTryin to find out where the party at\nGot a couple of them stacks finna mix it wit the Co-ni-ac\nWeight a minute, weight a minute\nWeight a minute, weight a minute\nI'm at the club where the V.I.P\nStupid niggas at the door tryin to say they wanna see I.D\nWeight a minute, weight a minute\nWeight a minute, weight a minute\nI'm big balla but I don't drink champagne\nWhite mink to da flo' color cocaine\nGator boots and the belt wit the low frame\nCandy coated Monte Carlo wit the upgrain\nWeight a minute now they wanna see a bitch ball\nI'm iced out from my tittie to my tip toe\nWe at the bar finna but the whole thang out\nAnd if somebody wanna start we can bang out\nI let my chain swang down to my waistline\nI won't dance we just move to the base line\nTell a nigga wait a minute fo i take mine"

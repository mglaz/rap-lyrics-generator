'Cause nigga, I'm right here\nI don't shop at the mall, all y'all just\nDumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist\nYou can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet\nAnd you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit\nNigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin\nCons, overalls, and a striped shirt\nThe boy drips swag like a broken faucet\nIt's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit\nThat cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston\nWon't stop 'til the cops surround him\nOne nigga jiggy and the other awesome\nWith his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him\nIt's Young T\n\n\nWho dat boy?

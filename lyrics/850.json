        "\nSaucy\n\n\nYour momma told me, \"Read the Book of Job\"\nThey should've called it the Book of Soul\nI came into this hurtful Earth in perfect health\nCaught Stevens-Johnson syndrome when I was 10 years old\nInternal and external fever, 80%...\nFatality rate at that time, ain't that some shit?\nSevere pinkeye, my eyes swollen shut\nFor like two or three months, it's still bright as fuck\nOh, and I even lost my lip skin\nGrew back darker than its original pigment\nSkin disfigured from boils and blisters\nUnidentifiable by my little sister\nCome to think of it, I could've got a crazy check\nThe shrink thought I'd be traumatized, but I'ma ride\nMy first years of Junior High School were not alright\nThem dimes wouldn't give me no time, no, not a nod\nI mean not even you, we eventually got cool\nBut I was nobody, you was the hottest hottie in the school\nOr the world to me, not saying that 'cause I'm your dude\nI'm glad I got to watch the woman that you blossomed to\nIronic, we always had the same classes\nI copied off your work\nAnd you ain't always have the right answers\nBut it worked, mama, thanks a lot\nProbably wouldn't have even graduated had you not\nSomewhere down the line, we became an item\nThe love was in the air like this flight I'm lighting\nThe first few years were so exciting\nGot deeper in this rap and started pushing shit back\nMy money got funny, you wanted to go on dates\nI had a Sounwave beat tape tryna beat Drake\nCould've spent every minute with you, but I had to get it\nFor me and you, you sing too, so you knew the business\nI know it was hard, but you stayed down\nMy fam had doubts, you told me you was proud\nI did some things, you did some things, always came back together\nWe knew the only way to make it work is work together\nSeven whole years, seven whole years\nIt was supposed to end with our grandkids\nLuckily for me, I'm used to being cut short\nI'm such a nice guy, why, Lord?\nWhy Lori? Why you had to take her from me?\nGuess He needed your angel face for all of Heaven to see\nYour picture's still on my mirror, and it's so scary\nI swear I still ain't looked at your obituary\nSo now, I'm so doped up, I think I'm flying\nI hope this spliff'll never finish\nI guess the Mayans wasn't lying\n2012, my world ended\nYou used to say that I could see the future\nYou was wrong, 'cause you was in it\nAnd I was just with you the day before\nYou said you loved me, I said I loved you more\nAnd as much I wanna cower, bid the mic adieu\nAnd fall off a fucking tower tryna find you\nI gotta stay 'cause I remember that day\nI looked you in the face and told you:\n\"Nothing can stop me, not even you\"\nStick to the plan, I'll meet you at our spot\nIf reincarnation is true and we don't get too lost\nEven if you forget me and everything you left behind\nI never lied, I love you in a place where there's no space and time\nI close my eyes, and I can still hear you singing loud\nWe never got to tell them who The Love Religion was about\nI ain't finna stage a cry in this rhyme\nSigned, sincerely yours, I live to let you...\n\n\nDot-da, da-da-da\nDa-da, da-da, da\nShine\nDa da da, da-da-da-da\nOooh...\n\n\nEverything I love the most gets taken away\nMy momma and music is next\nAnd if that happens before I turn 28\nThen I'm going out with Kurt Cobain\nI still believe in God, we just ain't never spoke\nUnless we talkin' symbolically\u2014then, I might agree\nBut if you really wanna look at it that way\nThen, ayy, man, God don't like me\nI refuse to believe that\nBut what's acceptable is anything's possible, but nobody's special\nMy ma took my TV, Clem took my radio\nNow, I'm on TV and on the radio\n\n\nDon't be dethroned by these systems of control\nJust keep your fingers crossed and get them locks off your soul\nDon't be dethroned by these systems of control\nJust keep your fingers crossed and get them locks off your soul\n\n\nSoul!"

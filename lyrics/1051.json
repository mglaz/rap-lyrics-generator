        "\nLook, before I start I want to say, that I was never proud of what happened between me and Dose\nAnd that's why we here today. To do this for hip hop. Aight\n\nHe still look like a sucka!\nA stupid motherfucker right!?\nHe the type to put his hat brim in ya face and start a fucking fight\nWell I never been a pussy nigga, tell me what it's like\nFronting like you hard, then running for ya fucking life\nCause when these Philly niggas see the iron\nYou gon see enough bodies on the ground to fill them coffins that FEMA hiding\nYou think he a gangsta go watch the fucking tube\nSo they can see we fold you up like I was cuffing Tru's\nSome of y'all new that battle I wasn't fucking cool\nUntil a hat brim in ya face and it's touching you\nReal niggas respect niggas space or its bust a move\nGet ya shit rocked like a thrift shop its nothing new\nI'm from Brooklyn no work then we go to rob\nAnd take ya work, BIG BANG! Off the word of God\nLight switch turn em off we turn to Mike Vick\nCause we come back around with them same numbers Like we ain't murder dog\nGo ahead and talk hard, we know you ain't about to flip Remember when \"Chill dog, I'm only 19.\" was coming out ya lips?\nI could just give you some bars and get you out this bitch\nBut you the one who broke our agreement and Smack can vouch for this\nNow you here on this stage, you must've upped ya luck\nYou lost on 106 three times cause you fucking suck\nHaters said you gave me the shine, I'm like \"Enough's enough\"\nYou bout to feel my hardest punchline like when I fucked you up\nNow this next her is gon crush ya core\nI pushed you off the stage and ran behind you to fuck you up some more\nI said \"Get outta my face\" he said \"what's up than dawg?\" Tech 9 when its check time, another fucking fraud\nThis battle rap shit there ain't no competitors\nY'all seen how I was slaying the predator\nI'm better than you I be the best 'fore I D-I-E\nAnd I ain't falling back again ghost of B-I-G\nNo possession shit\nUnless we talking a weapon that I done crept in with\nGet off the handle than it's the handle I teach the lesson with\nShit is deep they thought Polo got murked off\nBut I'm the one URL chaps got ya birth off\nThere's two types of niggas in life\nThe niggas that find bitches and fuck em and the niggas that.... trust 'em\nWho grind riches from nothing and the niggas that's suffering\nBehind hiccups is bustin and the niggas that's duckin\nThe niggas who pop shit versus the niggas that snuff em\nYo my original verse was like a prophecy\nAn ill introduction to the to the realest two gorillas Hoffa live it, they fronting\nIf you came here to fight, let's skip thru the bluffin'\nI punch a hole thru this bird and get a fist full of stuffing\nI told you give me my space, you said \"Let's get it, it's nothing\".\"\nYou disrespectful so I checked you..... end of discussion\nHOFFA!\n\n\nI should start this off by knocking you the fuck out!\nBut I'ma spit some bars cousin\nSee the whole time ya thought karma was a bitch, but I'm far from it\nSee I ain't gotta get my point cross\nYou can already tell where I'm headed soon as the coin toss\nSpeculation when y'all seen me it's like \"WOW he really survived\"\nOr \"he really revived\"\nOr some much dirt thrown on my name thought I was buried alive\nSee J. Dose was never dead just certain things that was never said\nWhich is why he got some better cred\nAnd I know a close mouth ain't never fed\nBut defeat was never on my mind an you know I'm a step ahead\nYou see I'm an ahead of myself I had to rewind myself to remind myself I'm behind myself\nSimultaneously beyond myself so fast I had to time myself\nLook at the clock and surprise myself\nSee I don't wanna get beside myself\nBut there ain't no competition besides myself\nSee only I can tie myself and if I do than I'm, well, by myself\nIt apparently doesn't show that I'm myself\nSo imagine if I combine myself\nDose\nYeah I know I went back in the past to give Vlad the beginning round\nBut I came back just in time to finish line\nI give a fuck what you haters say I'm still attacking the lyrical\nYou know a picture say a thousand words an just imagine the video\nSo homie don't run lip 'fore that barrel get tongue lit\nIn other words I can arrange/orange to get son kissed/Sunkist\nChoppers with drum clips bangin' till numbness\nAin't a genie but rubbing me the wrong way is nothing you wanna wish\nThis rap world is on some dumb shit\nL'ma speak on behalf of those who well actually come to spit\nAll the way from T-Rex to well my son Clips\nAnd if Mook was here I bet he'd wanna trip\nCause in these battles niggas drop albums\nAnd he still relevant off, well, one hit\nI mean that's gotta be demoralizing to a rappers ego\nI guess now I know how quarterbacks fell about Tebow\nBut this times tables are turned, ain't nothing screwed\nMy boy problems, add them, that's not a plus for you\nBut don't mind us/minus unless you wanna lose\nSee just cause I got class don't mean I let you pass\nI just rather do the math than divide through the half\nLet the Eagle/equal do/to a W\nAnd fuck what happened man, you scaring who?\nListen, before I let anything land, this pair'll shoot/parachute\nI ain't about the rap, the field is where you'll find me at\nAsk Dolls, I play the corner where the drivers at\nI put cheese on ya head if you trying to trap\nI'm a Packer plus all my G's ride in packs\nWhat's in ya pocket? Let me find out you copping sacks\nYou in a Lembo? We airing (Aaron), Roger that!\nHere to set the record straight, 40 make him levitate\nGive this nigga wings an he can really be a featherweight\nYou get a box, I ain't talking in a ring I got a bullet in my neck, this nigga talkin bout a swing?!\nWhile you was making blogs about what we did at the gym\nI was trying to learn how to walk and move my fingers again\nSee my boy detrimental, I been mixing since 10\nAnd still gutter ball/bol and that's without hitting the pen/pin\nSo go ahead start swinging again\nI put a price on ya head tag on ya toe, cut ya living expense\nThese other rappers ain't give him an inch\nI'm in the same spot Calicoe was at\nAnd I wish this nigga would/wood cause its getting intense/in tents\nYou don't wanna scrap, I'ma let a hundred clap\nTo ya family tree I'm like a lumberjack\nAnd I don't know why ya gun is strapped\nYou ain't buckin no more Ya warring done/Warren Dunn, see him running back\nRunning for my life, nigga I will run ya wife\nI'II fuck ya dream girl till her ass cum/come to life\nI ain't a pimp, that's the worse lie\nSince I blew/blue birds follow me like Twitter you can check just to verify\nMoney, cars, clothes all a nigga knows\nTriple six zero z's, all a nigga flows\nGot the world in my palm I could cross him with the globe\nThe way Brooklyn on the net you would thought he facing Hov\nYa whole city watching probably Diddy watching\nWhat you gonna do does he get an option\nYou a cold pussy I'ma bout to finger pop him\nPut a price on ya head and send my niggas shopping Rah!\nThey'll find you sleep and awake\nGet it? Sleep in a wake\nYou a full time rapping battle, I'll have em laughing at you\nCut ya throat to play pool with ya Adams apple\nWhat can you draw that haven't already saw?\nWhat can you say you want YouTube to play?\nI mean what could you even mention dude that wasn't on ya interviews\nThe more magnified the more it became minuscule\nAn interview here, an interview there\nThis man had more interviews/inner views than a rear view mirror\nSave ya breath fam, you giving me a breath tan\nHis breath an hot his mic need a sweatband\nBefore, you could've got signed by Def Jam\nNow you wouldn't get signed by a deaf man\nLow pro, got no flow, nigga you're loco\nRap sucks, ya gassed up, call him Sunoco\nOh no, so-so flow making them no shows\nNo joke, got Dose flows up in a choke hold\nHomo, you old though, busting a fo' fo'\nHit  with Cinco, something like Ocho\nOr that super Smith'n the one that's busting with logos\n\nEncompassed by dollars on my Jerry Jones flow\nA star up on the field I ain't talking logo\nYou think it's a game, it's more like a post show\nGet 9 out the Cal boy Ton' Romo\nBLAOW! Leave a mess on ya chest It's Dose bitch\nAka the best of the best\nWant war? Hope you got an S on ya chest\nCause what I shoot you gon need a vest on a vest\nI'm a motherfucking rider\n5 to that chopper\nBang his mid frame turn his body to a tire\nHA! That boy Dose you better ask about him\nHead of my class I don't worry about no Math problem\nWhat you know about bringing ya mom to the side\nWith a brace around ya neck cause you caught one up in the spine\nSeeing her smile erode while looking in her eyes\nThen tell her ya son just died\nMy brother caught a wig shot right up the street from me\nEver since then nigga I ain't living peacefully\nMy baby moms said I went crazy and gave the peace to me\nIt's cool cause she ain't the only one that be leaving me/believe in me\nI'm a motherfucking prospect quick to let that nine peck\nSpit R til it's contact lift him like a sky jet\nI got places where I hit him when I use the tool about to get the shotty\nBut the collar get the medulla shooter\nFlow colder than juice of coolers\nThese cats dig me like a pooper scooper\nI'm the shit cause everybody feeling me\nI'm superior lyrically I done killed ya ass so bad to the point where you had to swing on me\nWhat next? Pull a gun out? Shoot the God?

They know whafs up in the booth\nYeah I could make the transition but I'm stuck on the truth\nWack battles, wack music, who gives a fuck about Mook?\nSmack wassup I'm trying to battle Lux up on the roof\nDNA fixed his tooth now he smooth for the viewers\nT-Rex a check away from removing his tumor\nYou named yourself Dose that's what ruined ya future\nCause being number two in a battle makes you the loser\nYou blew the opportunity that BET lent you\nPhilly niggas hate you they b-e-t against you\nI know deep inside ya mind defeating me is essential\nBut if you the one that gave me shine than I'm the deity that sent you\nLucifer\nNow I'm in ya scenery to tempt you\nAre you gon be like me and just repeat what we done went through?\nOr we gonna be emcees and paint the scene like we was meant to?\nNow l'ma close my eyes...no surprise\nYou on a frequency, it's mental...\nNow ya kids can look up to you\nGet a job, work hard, live comfortable\nCause battling after me punking you is not gonna he enough for you\nBut you a grown man Dose so you gon do just what you want to do\nBut keep in mind I could've battled Hitman if I wanted to\nBut I got you paid and it wasn't just to take a dump on you\nThey could never say I don't give a shit, I took a number 2\nYou don't got bars like that\nYou he the running man my nigga, you ain't hard like that\nI know ya'll like \"Damn, why he ain't tap his jaw like that?\"\nCome see my next battle I'ma bring them bars right back\n\n\nI'm sure after hearing all these bars y'all wondering why I ain't been nowhere around\nI'm talking years right now\nWell they say if you build it they will come\nAnd that should explain why I'm here right now\nSee I let him build and build and build\nTo the top so I could tear him right down\nAnd as a result literally make me the top tier right now\nTwo types of niggas in life huh?\nWell which kind are you?\nThe one that put ya homies in a life threatening situation\nCause on some real I don't think you know a real nigga limitations\nSomebody could've got killed what if my partner was strapped\nYa publicity stunt woulda been nullified if ya man died over rap\nAnd that's probably why they not here, been dodging this match\nPlus we haven't seen them since where all them guys in the back\nOh! well I'm guessing they not for your crap\nThey probably know everything you did was kind of an act\nAnd aside from the fact you got poppin and scrapped\nI know all Brooklyn niggas wasn't rockin with that\nYou know two types of niggas in life huh\nYeah the ones that peep a vulnerable situation and try to exploit it\nClaiming they real when integrity arise they decide to ignore it\nYou know the kind that get around a bunch of new niggas and try to impress\nDo everything in the book except rocking a dress\nSee I know, see a lil kid outside of his city got gritty got busy\nYou knew attacking my size the only way to fight with me\nBut in ya favor the naive couldn't recognize the deal\nBut tell me what you see in the mirror cause you know, real recognize real\nTwo types of niggas in life huh, that still ain't clear HOLD SON!\nLast time I checked it takes one to know one\nI only know one and that's real\nThan he says \"Finally, daddy's spending time with me.\"\nAlright pop, what you glorifying? Deadbeats?\nWait, wait, I get it, I get it he when he says \"Get out my face...son\" he was serious clearly\nEither that or this dude's confused\nYou know the bars an hot made him lose his cool\nI probably catch a case or hit the cell for attacking with bars\nCause once he adapt to the ER I'll probably get a battery charge\nWhat you asking me for? You ain't ask for that\nCause what I rapped really happened, you just happened to rap\nOK, you put the smack in the Smack\nLet's keep it real, because ya rapping was wack\nYou know last time I checked\nSmack was for rap\nIn that case why didn't you put a smack in a track?\nOr a smack in the deal nah nah better yet a smack in the plaque\nWait I let me get it straight he if putting smack in the Smack really mattered in rap\nThan why are you trying to spark a flame by having this match\nI got bars something that you actually lack\nWith verses that make rappers wanna smack on the Smack\nSo go ahead you can have ya lil smack on the smack\nHope you get a cookie a trophy pat on ya back\nEnjoy it while it last cause you ain't having it back\nUnless you really got me chopped cause I ain't battling ask/ax\nThis nigga full of hot air til he catching a flat\nSo save ya breath for the pumps to ya as my attack/asthma attack\nI ain't rapping no mo' so cherish ya present or get ya box wrapped in a bow\nClapping a fo lay ya body flat on the flo'\nArms in the crowd, head in the back of the row\nYou only known cause you did what never happened befo'\nTell me this you think a fanatical blow is an actual show?\nSo I guess \"Get out my face son\" was a rap that you wrote\nAnd if those were your components on how to master a flow\nAfter that one hit wonder why you could never actually blow? So don't get full of ya self and make a fool of ya self\nCause in the and Math you only fooling ya self\nSee this kid, I got dumb rhymes not just sometimes\nSo I don't have to use a swing for a punchline\nYou shoulda known that nothing would last\nI mean I'm young, the future, stuck in the past\nPac Juice? Now you know you can't tell him shit\nWould someone tell this fucking pussy he won't sell a bit\nI mean this shit got wild\nYou just don't need a stylist you need a list of styles\nSee me I give the manager illusions\nWalk inside the Louie store they like \"the mannequin is moving\"\nOh you mad cause I\u2019m styling on you?\nTo and try that shit these Philly niggas wildin' on you\nMath that's only if I ain't on you\nYou ain't never ride I'ma put some mileage on you\nHomie when that chrome to ya cranium\nClick Clack BOOM!

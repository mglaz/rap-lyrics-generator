        "\nI must be Jim Morrison to get a motherfucking girl like you\nDon\u2019t know what I did in my past life, but it must have been something cool\nCause I\u2019m a whiskey drinking, fight provoking, cigarette smoking dude\nI got a problem with my attitude, it\u2019s hard for me to keep cool\nBut when I look at you, I see me, a reflection of a real soul\nSo, pardon me if I may seem loose and out of control\nIt ain\u2019t the drink talking, it\u2019s me talking; fuck if everyone knows\nYou my girl and that\u2019s that, so hop on the back of this bike and roll\nLet\u2019s roll now\n\n\nI\u2019d never let someone straight up disrespect you\nI\u2019d never let someone call you out your name\nI\u2019ll always be the one that runs up to protect you\n\u2018Cause I know if I was down, you\u2019d come and do the same\nSo let\u2019s pack it up and move our life to Nashville\nBuild a studio in the house and do our thing\nAnd I\u2019ll take you out and we\u2019ll go honky tonkin\u2019\nGet drunk and fall in Tennessee Love\nTennessee Love\nFall in Tennessee Love\nFall in Tennessee Love\nFall in Tennessee Love\n\n\nCan\u2019t you see that my hands are shaking?\nWithdrawals from alcohol Ain\u2019t no use in us fakin'\nBut it\u2019s our life, ain\u2019t it baby? So ain\u2019t no use in us takin'\nA chance with it, so I promise that I\u2019ll work on my patience\nSomeday, if we get lucky and we grow and get old\nWe\u2019ll look back, and laugh about the circus and the show\nBut for now, we live it up, we spend it up, and we go\nTo the last call in every bar in this town turn the lights on and close\nYou and me now\n\n\nI\u2019d never let someone straight up disrespect you\nI\u2019d never let someone call you out your name\nI\u2019ll always be the one that runs up to protect you\n\u2018Cause I know if I was down you\u2019d come and do the same\nSo let\u2019s pack it up and move our life to Nashville\nBuild a studio in the house and do our thing\nAnd I\u2019ll take you out and we\u2019ll go honky tonkin\u2019\nGet drunk and fall in Tennessee Love\nTennessee Love\nFall in Tennessee Love\nFall in Tennessee Love\nFall in Tennessee Love\n\n\nWhen I first met you I was so broke\nAnd I tried to hide behind the Alabama pines, prayin\u2019 that you didn\u2019t know\nAbout my problems, \u2018cause I couldn\u2019t bear to see you go\nAnd when you found out all that happened, your little heart was broke\nAnd I had to earn it back and I learned in fact\nThat money don\u2019t fix that shit\nNot tattoos and I love you\u2019s\nIt\u2019s trust that I had to get\nI\u2019m sorry that I ever hurt you\nFor anything that I did\nCan I put this ring on your finger\nLet you know that I\u2019m serious?\nMarry me now\n\n\nI\u2019d never let someone straight up disrespect you\nI\u2019d never let someone call you out your name\nI\u2019ll always be the one that runs up to protect you\n\u2018Cause I know if I was down, you\u2019d come and do the same\nSo let\u2019s pack it up and move our life to Nashville\nBuild a studio in the house and do our thing\nAnd I\u2019ll take you out and we\u2019ll go honky tonkin\u2019\nGet drunk and fall in Tennessee Love\nTennessee Love\nFall in Tennessee Love\nFall in Tennessee Love\nFall in Tennessee Love"

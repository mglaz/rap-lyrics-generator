        "\nAll you a lie\nNigga, I ain't ever been a \"yes\" man\nAll you gonna die, you can get murdered on webcam\nI don't get tired; sweat through a headband\nYou might look alive, that's 'cause you don't really know you a dead man\n\n\nThis is God's plan, someone stop me\nI've been sent here from Illuminati\nEvil scriptures written on my body\nMe and Satan pull up in a red Ferrari\nDon't be tryin' to put your fuckin' arm around me\n44 shots traumatizin' from the .45, hit 44 more\nCarbon copies say you kamikazes\nThat's for e'rybody\nMama, Poppy\nSister, Brother, Cousin, Uncle, Auntie\nThis is not Versace, this is hot hibachi\nThis is Hiroshima, this is Nagasaki\nI'm Mahatma Gandhi, a fuckin' humanoid Anunnaki\nWith plenty hammers when I'm ridin' shotty\nBetter use your manners when you talk about me\nAin't too hard to find me\nI've been killin' niggas, still ain't nothin' left though\nJoyner Lucas sicker than a strep throat\nSpanish bitch that wanna give me besos\nThey must've forgot I was next up\nSpeed out your crib right after I clean out your shit and then put all of your fuckin' money in a escrow\nFuck what you sayin', I'm not the one that you play with\nI think they really mistaken, I wasn't next up?\nYou thought wrong and you all gone, all done\nI just might bring back Don Juan, I just might bring back Sean John\nTell P Diddy that I'm on one\nI'ma beat it down with a Du-Rag\nPussy ate out, that's a PopCon\nIf I don't fuck with you, that's too bad (God damn)\nHo, you played out like the thong song\nAin't no bygones bein' bygones\nI should murder niggas when I buy guns\nHo, you get stretched like Nylon\nThis is my band, I'm Dylon\nAll I wanna do is just drop bombs\nOn you cheerleadin' niggas with the pom-poms\nMy Jamaican bitch got socks on\nEvery time I hit it she be like, \"wagwan\"\nPeter Piper picked a pepper, and I picked the pressure\nPick a fight, I pick a side, I put you on a stretcher\nPeter Piper picked up a nine, I put it together\nStarted poppin' at the people, they 'bout to meet the Beretta\nBetter meet the metal, I'ma need a Fujita to measure\nPut you deeper than what's deeper the sea or the desert\nI've been schemin' while I'm creepin', like fifty feet to the Jetta\nNiggas speed and hit the pedal, I put my feet in the metal\nGod damn!\n\n\n508 all on my side, they gon' ride, they gon' ride\nNigga, this a homicide, oh my god, oh my god\nI said I was gon' retire, bitch I lied, bitch I lied\nI ain't got no fuckin' job, this my life, this my, wait\u2014\n\n\nAll of y'all wishy and washy\nAll y'all my kids in a car seat\nI take my dime to hibachi, we do 69 like Tekashi\nLyin' in the sand, too much time in your hands\nI think I need to find you a hobby\nGod got a plan, hope that God hold your hand\nI think I'm 'bout to catch me a body!\nTell all my teachers that I said I'm back on my G shit\nAnd I'm comin' back to get even\nI went on tour and got paid, now I'm back in the region\nI let off this mac for no reason\nYou are now witnessin' greatness\nI'm practically preachin' and this is the passion of Jesus\nAnd all you basic motherfuckas are lackin' achievement\nAnd I've just been laughin' and geekin'\nBack to business, I got mad intentions\nI ain't perfect, I done made some bad decisions\nBut it's competition, I'm a savage winnin'\nYou can have the digits, I'm a mathematician\nI don't see you niggas, I've been lackin' vision\nYou've been actin' different, I've been actin' distant\nI'ma do some shit to bring me mad attention\nYou gon' do some shit that send me back to prison, whoa!\nThis is uncomfortable, you just keep puttin' your feet in a fire\nI think my gun got a crush on you, boy\nYou 'bout to meet your secret admirer\nHow you do shit you don't wanna do?\nI do that shit just to keep me inspired\nI used to hit it and leave when I wanted to\nNow I hit it and be sleepin' aside her, woo\nRoll up on 'em when I pull up on 'em\nPut that motherfuckin' smoke up on 'em with that holy water\nJoyner Lucas, I'm a holy mona leader motor runnin'\nMan, too many niggas know about it, but I thought about it\nPrayed about it to the Lord about it in the mornin', but I gotta show 'em what it's all about and I'ma call 'em out\nI ain't that nigga you could talk about, you better calm it down\nDon't be tryna give me the runaround, I'ma shut 'em down god damn, wait\n\n\n508 all on my side, they gon' ride, they gon' ride\nNigga this a homicide, oh my god, oh my god\nI said I was gon' retire, bitch I lied, bitch I lied\nI ain't got no fuckin' job, this my life, this my\n\n\nThis is God's plan, someone stop me\nI was sent here from Illuminati\nEvil scriptures written on my body\nMe and Satan pull up in a red Buggati\nDon't be tryna put your fuckin' arm around me\nBring the drama, it ain't hard to find me\nThis a lucid dream, this a out-of-body\nUFO flyin' while I'm ridin' shotty\nI'm a ninja, pull up on a Kawasaki\n187 on the cops behind me\nThis is Hiroshima, this is Nagasaki\nI'm Mahatma Gandhi in a Maserati, god damn\nNow call me Papi\nPlenty hammers when I'm ridin' shotty\nBetter use your manners when you talk about me\nIt ain't hard to find me, motherfucker\nMy name Joyner"

        "\nLips meet teeth and tongue\nMy heart skips eight beats at once (That's better)\nIf we were meant to be, we would have been by now\nSee what you wanna see, all I see is him right now\nH-h-him right now\n\n\nI'll sit and watch your car burn\nWith the fire that you started in me\nBut you never came back to ask it out\nGo ahead and watch my heart burn\nWith the fire that you started in me\nBut I'll never let you back to put it out\n(Thanks)\n\n\nYour love feels so fake\nMy demands aren't high to make\nIf I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now (Ahh)\nYour lies will never keep, I think you need to blow them out\n(B-b-blow them out)\n\n\nI'll sit and watch your car burn\nWith the fire that you started in me\nBut you never came back to ask it out\nGo ahead and watch my heart burn\nWith the fire that you started in me\nBut I'll never let you back to put it out\n\n\n7-4-2008\nI still remember that\nHeaven sent a present my way\nI won't forget your laugh\nPacking everything when you leave\nYou know you coming back\nWanna see me down on my knees\nBut that was made for a ring\nI try to wait for the storm to calm down\nBut that's stubborn, baby, leading to war\nWe droned down on each other\nTryin' to even the score\nWe all been found guilty in the court of aorta\n\n\nAnd I'll watch your car burn\nWith the fire that you started in me\nBut you never came back to ask it out\nGo ahead and watch my heart burn\nWith the fire that you started in me\nBut I'll never let you back to put it out\n\n\nWatch your car, watch your car burn\nI won't forget your laugh\nGo ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn\nYou know you coming back, you know you coming back\nWatch your car, watch your car burn\n(Go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn)\nTryna even the score\nGo ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn\nFound guilty in the court of aorta"

        "\nIt is I, the B-I-G, the B-O-I\nMe, oh my, ears to the street and eyes to the sky\nKept my sights on the prize, wide open, worldwide\nLike the thighs of a hooker spread, told the girl, \"Bye\"\nI got bigger fish to fry, niggas wish I would retire\n'Cause of the pressure I apply every time I bust a rhyme\nNone of the rest of ya are tryin'\nWatch me stimulate the minds of the masses\nWhile you niggas kickin' it like jackasses\nAnd who you votin' for, Republican or Democratic?\nDon't say it doesn't matter 'cause that's how they stole the last one\nAssassin's bullet might be waitin' for Obama\nDo you think they'll have a brother before Billy's baby mama? C'mon!\n\n\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\n\nMy daddy told me it was mine for the takin'\nA true gift from God, the stars aligned when they made me\nHim and Rena's baby, their first born son\nI'm Antwan Andr\u00e9 Patton, the only one\nBloodline of a champion with heart of the lion\nI'm defyin' all the laws like a caterpillar flying\nWay before my time and reside in the Dirty Dirty\nWhere they still hangin' nooses like we in the early '30s\nGoddamn, you know who I am? (\"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\")\nRoyal fam of Atlanta, Dungeon, bitch, you understand?\nThis ain't what you want, let's be clear from the bungie\nI write knockout songs, you spit punchlines for money\n\n\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\n\nWith my ears to the streets and my eyes to the sky\nI'm on another planet, my nigga, and you just fly\n(Why?) Cause I'm (\"Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax\")\nTake that, motherfucker, take that!\nWith my ears to the streets and my eyes to the sky\nI'm on another planet, my nigga, and you just fly\n(Why? 'Cause he's Daddy Fat Sax)\nRidin' off in the Cadillac like that, nigga\n\n\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\"Look at the way you look at me\" \u2013 \"Da-Daddy Fat Sax\"\n\"In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps\"\n\n\nYea (\"Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax\")\nWhat his name is? (\"Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax\")\nWhat ya talkin 'bout? (\"Da-Da-Daddy Fat Sax\")\nBoy, stop!"

        "\nMeth lab in the back\nAnd the crack smoke peels through the streets\nLike an early-morning fog\nMomma's in the slaughterhouse with the hatchet\nHelping Daddy chop early-morning hog\nI'm catching Zs like an early-morning saw\nWhen I woke up to the racket, yawn and pause\nWhat the fuck, man? I can never get sleep, man\nPeeped out the window, what's wrong with y'all?\nStood up in my Crimson Tide Alabama sweatpants\nAnd threw my pillow\nLooks like Daddy caught the motherfucker\nThat tried to sneak in and steal his elbows\nThey don't know that old man don't hold hands or throw hands\nNah, he's rough like a Brillo\nWent to the Chevy and pulled out a machete\nAnd a gun as heavy and tall as that midget, Willow\n\n\nThink he's playin'?\nYou better listen what he's sayin', punk\nDon't make me go pop the trunk\nOn you\nHe got an old Mossberg\nIn the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy\nDon't make me go pop the trunk\nOn you\nThink he's playin'?\nYou better listen what he's sayin', punk\nDon't make me go pop the trunk\nOn you\nHe got an old Mossberg\nIn the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy\nDon't make me go pop the trunk\nOn you\n\n\n11:30, and I'm pulling up dirty\nSmoking babbage out the back of my buddy's Monte Carlo\nSpitting over some Supa Hot Beats\nWith a super hot freak we call \"the parking lot ho\"\nYou know we sipping on that old brown bottle\nBass in the trunk make the whole town wobble\nSo when we ride around, bitches follow\nAnd tonight, one of them bitches is giving us problems\nWell, one of them bitches\nBeen fucking one of my homeboy's favorite bitches\nAnd he's been on his hit list for a minute\nAnd I think he's ready to handle his business\nHe told me \"Yelawolf, get this\"\nAnd he handed me the Cartier watch that was on his wrist\nHe said \"Watch this shit\"\nAnd he jumped to the trunk and grabbed his biscuit, biscuit\n\n\nThink he's playin'?\nYou better listen what he's sayin', punk\nDon't make me go pop the trunk\nOn you\nHe got an old Mossberg\nIn the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy\nDon't make me go pop the trunk\nOn you\nThink he's playin'?\nYou better listen what he's sayin', punk\nDon't make me go pop the trunk\nOn you\nHe got an old Mossberg\nIn the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy\nDon't make me go pop the trunk\nOn you\n\n\nTwo men stand\nOne's gotta go\nOne falls down to the ground\nOne walks down to the road\nMomma better call the police\nNow he's screaming, \"No!\"\nTook a buckshot to the chest\nWith a rock-salt shell, and he's moving slow\nAll this blood has spilled\nEnough to give a penguin chills\nHot enough to make a potato smoke\nAt the tip of the hollowed steel\nIn the valley of the hollowed field\nIn the valley of the hollowed tip\nThis ain't a figment of my imagination, buddy\nThis is where I live! Bama!\n\n\nThink he's playin'?\nYou better listen what he's sayin', punk\nDon't make me go pop the trunk\nOn you\nHe got an old Mossberg\nIn the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy\nDon't make me go pop the trunk\nOn you\nThink he's playin'?\nYou better listen what he's sayin', punk\nDon't make me go pop the trunk\nOn you\nHe got an old Mossberg\nIn the Mossy Oak duffle bag laying in the back of the dump, boy\nDon't make me go pop the trunk\nOn you"

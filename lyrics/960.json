        "\nYeah, this just my life\nFront to back, top to bottom\n\n\nEverything's changing around me\nThese days don't feel the same\nWe all lost faith and lost family\nWhy must we play this game?\nLord have mercy on me\nI've been a sinning man\nPull out my wings, jump off the bridge\nAnd crash in a plane, if I never land\n\n\nKnow I never die\nWe live forever in my mind\nAnd I sanctify\nWe live forever, still alive\n\n\nThere's a lot going on but I stick to the ones I love\nI never claimed to be a perfect man but name a great man who was\nConsequences of my actions in the past years had me stressing out\nIt was like, May, I just moved to L.A., I was tryna figure it out\nMedication for depression that I cut cold turkey, had the kid manic\nIn an episode out in Hollywood, wilding out like Nick Cannon\nRailing Adderall pills out a dollar bill, on the bathroom floor\nClean the whole mess up with my nose, what the fuck I need a vacuum for?\nNew York City on my birthday, June 6th, 2014\nI had that first meeting with Hov, plus I brought out the whole team\nI drank that whole bottle of D'usse Ty Ty gave me that night\nWhen we left the club, at the Rap Genius house me and shorty got into a fight\nShe came out the room swingin', hit me in the jaw\nI was really tryna fend her off\nBut I ended up in the closet with my hands around her neck\nI was tripping, dawg\nToo proud to apologize or empathize, I blamed it all on her\nSaying that she hit me first, even though she was the one hurt\nI was really just reflecting all the hurt that I was feeling from the band's rejection\nWhen Kids These Days split, that shit felt like a c-section\nAnd my infidelity and jealousy with Natalie on top of the amphetamines\nAnd the ecstasy had me tryna drown face down in the Chesapeake\nThe next month I dropped \"Down on My Luck\" and had Europe going nuts\nBut I couldn't even appreciate it at the time, I was going through too much\nNow I had to leverage million dollar label deals on the table for my records\nIn Ibiza eating paella on the roof, tryna choose over breakfast\nHov wasn't with the bidding war, but I knew the Roc just felt right\nWhen I saw Kanye at Wireless, without T-Pain, still a good life\nFelt so close when Mr. Hudson introduced me to him backstage\nHe prolly don't even remember that shit... like a bitch off Backpage\nBut at that stage, I was ready to swing for the fence like a batting cage\nAt the same time, I was winding down a low point in my addict phase\nThe Adderall started wearing off and I went into a deep writer's block\nAll over a song that I couldn't finish that I wrote about signin' to the Roc\nIsn't that ironic? I was feeling so psychotic\nWith the whole world excited for me and my idol saying I got it\nShit got bad out in L.A., so I moved back home to my mom's basement\nLinked up with Smoko and Papi Beatz and took it back to basics\nThen I wrote \"Rage,\" that was me screaming out through the pain\nAnd \"U Mad,\" addressing my relationship with Natalie, it was too bad\nThe violence and the lies slipped suicide into my mental health\nI did acid in the studio one day and almost killed myself\nAs I started to fall apart, certain stars started to align\nOm'Mas came to Chicago in January at the perfect time\nHe said Kanye was working on an album, and Uzi played him one of our songs\nHe was tryna fly me out, nigga, it was goin' down like the Dow Jones\nPulled up to Westlake, first day I was there, I recorded \"Wolves\"\nI knew I was the one, like Neo meeting with the Oracle\nBut I had to get a handle 'fore the door was pulled\nCrawled out on SNL\nAll the niggas hating on me back home lookin' at me like, \"FML\"\nA lot of people coming out the wood like, \"Let's work,\" tryna network\nAll the pressure making my head hurt, the molly wouldn't let the meds work\nAt this time it's like Feb. 1st to the 15th, and I'm still addicted\nFrustrated, writing shit for Ye, tryna visualize someone else's vision\nThen he laid that verse on \"U Mad\" and we made the shit the single\nYe and Hov getting into it over me, tryna do a joint venture\nAnd G.O.O.D. Music still fam, but it's that Roc boy SAVEMONEY life\nTook the bus out on the road for the Traffic tour, did a hundred nights\nCleaned out my closet, I got rid of all of my demons\nIf you learn one thing from my journey, nigga it's don't stop believing\nWhen this shit got so suffocating I could barely even keep breathing\nWrote my wrongs all in this song now I'd like to welcome y'all to my season\nNigga I'm gone\n\n\nKnow I never die\nWe live forever in my mind\nAnd I sanctify\nWe live forever, still alive"

        "\nIt's been a long day without you, my friend\nAnd I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\nWe've come a long way from where we began\nOh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\nWhen I see you again\n\n\nDamn, who knew?\nAll the planes we flew, good things we been through\nThat I'd be standing right here talking to you\n'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh\nBut something told me that it wouldn't last\nHad to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture\nThose were the days, hard work forever pays\nNow I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)\nUh\n\n\nHow could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?\nEverything I went through, you were standing there by my side\nAnd now you gon' be with me for the last ride\n\n\nIt's been a long day without you, my friend\nAnd I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)\nWe've come a long way (Yeah, we came a long way) from where we began\n(You know we started)\nOh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)\nWhen I see you again\n\n\nAah oh, aah oh\nWooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\nYeah\n\n\nFirst, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong\nAnd what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond\nAnd that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost\n(The love will never get lost)\nAnd when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed\nEstablished it on our own when that line had to be drawn\nAnd that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone\n(Remember me when I'm gone)\n\n\nHow could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?\nEverything I went through you were standing there by my side\nAnd now you gon' be with me for the last ride\n\n\nSo let the light guide your way, yeah\nHold every memory as you go\nAnd every road you take\nWill always lead you home, home\n\n\nIt's been a long day without you, my friend\nAnd I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\nWe've come a long way from where we began\nOh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again\nWhen I see you again\n\n\nAah oh, aah oh (Uh)\nYeah (Yeah)\nWooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yo)\nWhen I see you again (Yo, uh)\nSee you again (Yo, yo)\nOh-oh (Uh-huh)\n(Yup) When I see you again"

        "\nShe got me going psycho\nShe got me going down, down, down\nGot me living on a tightrope\nShe got me going down, down, down\nShe got me going psycho\nShe got me going down, down, down\nGot me living on a tightrope\nShe got me going down, down, down\n\n\nI don't know you, like\nI want to, so I\nMight call you tonight\nIf I do pick up\nI got some gin in me\nA hundred bands on me\nI'm feelin' myself, yeah\nI might say too much\n\n\nShe got me going psycho\nShe got me going down, down, down\nGot me living on a tightrope\nShe got me going down, down, down\nShe got me going psycho\nShe got me going down, down, down\nGot me living on a tightrope\nShe got me going down, down, down\n\n\nI don't know you but I know that you're special\nFuck a verse, fuck a hook, I'll use the whole instrumental\nJust to reiterate the commitment I have to exploring\nLike would you ride it like a horse, like my last name is Lauren\nI'm more than interested\nBaby I'm infatuated\nYou been held back\nI'll get you to graduation\nHelp you with your cash\nSteer you clear of tax evasion\nDeath grips on your ass\nI call that assassination\nI'm getting carried away\nLet's get married today\nFuck\nHere I go again like Whitesnake back in the day\nI'm crazy and you're crazy too\nBut I love that shit\nYou're bad and you're broken too\nBut I love that shit\nJust be open to the possibility of me and you\nThat's all I ask, I've had the hoes, I've got the cash now I want you\nJust be open to the possibility of me and you\nThat's all I ask, I've had the hoes, I've got the cash\n\n\nShe got me going psycho\nShe got me going down, down, down\nGot me living on a tightrope\nShe got me going down, down, down\nShe got me going psycho\nShe got me going down, down, down\nGot me living on a tightrope\nShe got me going down, down, down\n\n\nShe got me going psycho"

        "\nI know what you came here to see\nIf you're a freak, then you comin' home with me\nAnd I know what you came here to do\nNow bust it open, let me see you get loose\nIt's goin' down for real\nIt's goin' down for real\nIt's goin' down for real\n\n\nYo' girl just kissed a girl, I do bi chicks\nShake for a sheik, I'm throwin' these Emirates in the sky\nSpendin' this As-salamu alaykum, peace to M-O-N-E-Y\nI love my beaches, south beaches, surfboard in high tide\nI could just roll up 'cause I'm swole up\nSo that birthday cake get the cobra\nBugatti for real, I'm cold, bruh\nThat auto-biography rover\nGot the key to my city, it's over\nIt's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's\nI set records, ratchets hol' up\n(I set records, ratchets hol' up)\n\n\nI know what you came here to see\nIf you're a freak, then you comin' home with me\nAnd I know what you came here to do\nNow bust it open, let me see you get loose\nIt's goin' down for real\nIt's goin' down for real\nIt's goin' down for real\n\n\n(And they already know me)\nIt's going down further than femurs\nGirls get wetter than Katrina\nYeah, my girl, you've never seen her\n'Cause my tints by limousines\nMy touch say it's the Midas\nWe the plus, your man a minus\nMy team blowin' on that slam\nMake you cough-cough, that's Bronchitis\nPut your hands up, oh\nIt's a stick up, no more makeup\nGet that ass on the floor\nLadies, put your lipstick up\nDouble entendre, double entendre\nWhile you're hatin', I get money\nThen I double up tonkers\n\n\nI know what you came here to see\nIf you're a freak, then you comin' home with me\nAnd I know what you came here to do\nNow bust it open, let me see you get loose\nIt's goin' down for real\nIt's goin' down for real\nIt's goin' down for real\nIt's goin' down for real\nIt's goin' down for real\n\n\nLift it, drop it, shake it, pop it\nLift it, drop it, shake it, pop it\nLift it, drop it, shake it, pop it\nLift it, drop it, shake it\n\n\nIt's goin' down for real\nIt's goin' down for real\nIt's goin' down for real\nIt's goin' down for real\nIt's goin' down for real"

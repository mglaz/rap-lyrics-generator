        "Message to the world you know what I'm saying\nJust cause you locked up doesn't mean you invisible\nYou still exist and your words is felt\nSo peep and take heat to these thought to a comrade\nYou know what I'm saying-put it like this:\nYo, many people will walk in and out of your life\nBut only true friends will leave imprints in your heart\nIn our short experience that we shared\nImprints was left behind\nTo handle yourself is to use your head\nTo handle others is to use your heart\nAnger is only one letter short of danger\nIf somebody betrays you once, it's his fault\nIf he or she betrays you twice, it's your fault\nGreat Minds discuss ideas\nAverage minds discuss events\nSmall minds discuss people\nGod gives every bird it's food\nBut he who's not thrown into his nest\nHe or she loses money loses much\nHe or she who loses a friend loses more\nHe or she who loses faith loses it all\nLearn form the mistakes of other\nYou can't live long enough to make them all yourself\nThe tongue weighs practically nothing\nBut so few people can hold it\nFRIENDS- you and me we started a bond, a circle, a friendship\nAnd like that circle there is no beginning and there is no end\nOnly if it is between two true friends"

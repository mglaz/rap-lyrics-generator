        "\nSomething sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow\nA degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth\nWelcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work\n\"Golf\" is stitched into my shirt\nGet up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche\nPsyche, psyche\n\n\nCan I get that, oh\u2026 let me get that beat in my headphones, louder\n\n\nIt's probably been 12 years since my father left\nLeft me fatherless\nAnd I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest\nWhen honestly I miss this nigga, like when I was six\nAnd every time I got the chance to say it I would swallow it\nSixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots\nI storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model\nI'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn\nTrying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate\nMomma often was offering peace offerings\nThink, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again\nSearching for a big brother, Tyler was that\nAnd plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap\nToo black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks\nFrom honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks\nI'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained, and I'm frightened\nIt's evident in them eyes, where he hiding all them icicles at\n\n\nSomething sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow\nA degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth\nWelcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work\n\"Golf\" is stitched into my shirt\nGet up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche\nPsyche, psyche\n\n\nCan I get that, oh\u2026 let me get that beat in my headphones, louder\n\n\nUh\u2026 time lapse, bars rotten, heart's bottomless pit\nWas mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did\nWe were the pottymouth posse crash the party and dip\nWith all belongings then toss em out to the audience\nNothing was fucking awesome\nTrying to make it from the bottom\nHis sins feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is\nSupreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs\nWith Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article\nTolerance for boundaries, I know you happy now\nCraven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down\nJust to be the guys that did it, like, \"I like attention\"\nNot the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense\nSupposed to be grateful, right?\nLike, \"Thanks so much,\" you made my life harder\nAnd the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened\nEven more than they were before all of this shit\nBeen back a week and I already feel like calling it quits\n\n\nSomething sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow\nA degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth\nWelcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work\n\"Golf\" is stitched into my shirt\nGet up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche\nPsyche, psyche\n\n\nCan I get that, oh\u2026 let me get that beat in my headphones, louder"

        "\nI'm not the table you can come and lay your cup down on now\nI\u2019m not the shoulder for a bag, don't wanna carry your heavy load\nI'm not the road that you take when you're lookin' for a shortcut, uh\nI ain't the steppin' stone, to be steppin' on, I ain't nobody's crutch\nI ain't the money man, with your money man, you ain't lookin' at me\nI'm not the cheap one, lookin' at me son, you ain't lookin' at free\nI ain't the dishrag, to come clean up, all the shit that ya dish out\nAin't got no check for 'em, if you checkin' in\nMothafucka check this out\n\n\nAin't much I can do but I do what I can\nBut I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend\nJust because you got yourself in some shit\nIt doesn't mean I have to come deal with it\nYou handle your own when you become a man\nAnd become a man when you handle your own\nAin't much I can do but I do what I can\nBut what can I do if I do 'til it's gone\nOh, oh, 'til it's gone\nOh, oh, 'til it's gone\nOh, oh, 'til it's gone\nOh, but what can I do if I do 'til it's gone\n\n\nI'm not the trash can, not the last man at the finish line now\nI'm not the new kid, on the block\nThat you can just follow and push around\nI'm not the fuckin' needle in the haystack, that you finally found\nThis ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down\nI'm not a bus ride you can hop inside, and just roll away clean\nNot the wheel on the wagon you wanna break\n'Cause I hold up the weight for the team\nI'm not the gold watch, and the new truck\nThat you scheming to check out\nUnless you're looking to check out \nWhat a mess now (c'mon)\n\n\nAin't much I can do but I do what I can\nBut I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend\nJust because you got yourself in some shit\nIt doesn't mean I have to come deal with it\nYou handle your own when you become a man\nAnd become a man when you handle your own\nAin't much I can do but I do what I can\nBut what can I do if I do 'til it's gone\nOh, oh, 'til it's gone\nOh, oh, 'til it's gone\nOh, oh, 'til it's gone\nOh, what can I do if I do 'til it's gone\n\n\nI jump to the sky for my people\nI walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal\nDon't tell me not to complain about my money and fame\nWhen you come around and tellin' me I changed\nDamn right I fuckin' changed\nWhen this fuckin' change in my pocket\nHit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden\nI went from shoppin' without nothin'\nTo goin' shoppin' for my cousins\nNow that the cops know that I'm buzzin'\nThey wanna drop me in the oven\nPull me over just to say \"I'm a fan\"\nHip-hop, gotta love it, fuck it\n\n\nAin't much I can do but I do what I can\nBut I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend\nJust because you got yourself in some shit\nIt doesn't mean I have to come deal with it\nYou handle your own when you become a man\nAnd become a man when you handle your own\nAin't much I can do but I do what I can\nBut what can I do if I do 'til it's gone\nOh, oh, 'til it's gone\nOh, oh, 'til it's gone\nOh, oh, 'til it's gone\nOh, what can I do if I do 'til it's gone"

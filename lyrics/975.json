        "\nI hope no one discovers you\nHope no one sees her\nI hope no one falls in love with you\nI've got my reasons\n'Cause if they knew what I know then I know\nI wouldn't stand a chance\nThere's no way you would go for a man like me\nIf you had options\n\n\nEven though the world was made for you\nI hope you don't get famous\n'Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like I do, oh nah\nHope you don't get famous\nStay home with me\nStay home with me\nI'll always love ya, I'll always\nHope you don't get\nHope you don't get famous\nHope you don't get famous\nHope you don't get famous\nHope you don't get famous\nYeah\n\n\nBaby live your life, just how you are\nShining star\nHope you never get famous\nFlying low with the angels\nThey said \"fake it 'till you make it\"\nI guess you fake when you make it\nI told you \"stick to the basics\"\nBuilt an empire started from the basement\nIf you tryna fix a glass that's broken\nYou know it might cut ya hand\nNever want to see you with another man\nTruth might eat you if you're mumbling\nWhen it get too cold for a blanket\nNeed you hugging me\nBecause nobody gonna love you like I do\n\n\nEven though the world was made for you\nI hope you don't get famous\n'Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like the way I do, oh nah\nHope you don't get famous\nStay home with me\nStay home with me\nI'll always love ya, I'll always\nHope you don't get\nHope you don't get famous\nHope you don't get famous\nHope you don't get famous\nHope you don't get famous\nYeah\n\n\nAll day long I stand by you\nRight or wrong I stand by you\nKeep me strong, oh girl it's true\nKeep me strong, oh girl it's true\n\n\nEven though the world was made for you\nI hope you don't get famous\n'Cause everyone will love you but won't love you like  I do, oh nah\nHope you don't get famous\nStay home with me\nStay home with me\nI'll always love ya, I'll always\nHope you don't get\nHope you don't get famous\nHope you don't get famous\nHope you don't get famous\nHope you don't get famous\nYeah"

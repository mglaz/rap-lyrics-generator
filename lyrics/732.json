        "\nYeah, I almost got this\nIf she got it memorized\nThis for the haves and the have-wanna-give-a-fucks\nHey\n\n\nI ride around in your car\nI put my weed in your blunt\nI am the sky to your star\nI am the end of your month\nYou are the start of my day\nYou brought the smile from my face\nI see the world from your eyes\nYou pulled a thorn from my side\n\n\nI know you love me (Know you love me)\nIt's rare, I know you love me (Know you love me)\nOh yeah, I know you love me (Know you love me)\nIt's rare, I know you love me (Know you love me)\nYeah\n\n\nYou give me all that you got\nYou make it stretch it and flip\nI fell in love with your thoughts\nI learned it's more than your hips\nYou know I'm caught in my vibe\nBut I still give you my rib\nYou hear 'em callin' my name\nBut know it's hard for me here\nI left a home with my son\nI chose the world in the end\nI say, \"You know I be back\"\nYou try your best to pretend\nI say you all that I want\nAnd when I make it, it's real\nI hear 'em callin' my name\nIt's gettin' hard for me here\n\n\nTo know you love me (Know you love me)\nIt's rare to know you love me (Know you love me)\nBut yeah, I know you love me (Know you love me)\nIt's rare, I know you love me (Know you love me)\n\n\nYeah, yeah, and, and these stars\nAre nothin' but your cousins\nAnd starin' at your mama, Heaven wasn't falling in here\nSo holla, you heard I'm usin' narcotics\nNo, I don't wanna be here if I don't gotta\nMy weed habit so close to snortin' powder\nGot a few gripes but it's only 'bout a dollar bill\nSo holla unless you're usin' narcotics\nSee, I don't wanna be here if I don't gotta\nMy weed habit so close to snortin' powder\nGot a few bitches but it's only 'bout a dollar\nFeel so hollow unless you're usin' narcotics\nSee, I don't wanna\u2014\n\n\nSay, homie. Man, you talkin' bout this, you talkin' bout that\nTalkin' about, you ain't got nothin' to talk about. Man, my\u2014Find a motherfuckin' topic, Goddamn. Just find the topic, bro. Seriously. Goddamn. Complicated-ass young motherfuckers, man."

        "\nSouthern trees\nBearing strange fruit (Bearing strange fruit)\nBlood on the leaves (Blood on the leaves)\nAnd blood at the root, check (And blood at the roots)\nSo bleed\n\n\nEmit light, rap, or Emmett Till\nI drew a line without showing my body, that's a skill\nBad to the bone and the grill\nYou'd be dead wrong if looks killed\nI'm still on my spill, in the spirit of L. Hill\nEye on the sparrow, nose like a pharaoh's\nOur bloodline trill for the young and all the lils\nWe all gon' get mils\nTalk a lot of game but we get paid to like Jemele\nWas raised upon a hill, the valley's a sunken place\nI'm just tryna build like I came with some kettle weight\nKnow I'm a god emcee, 'cause nigga, I made the devil wait\n'Fore I brought hell, you ain't gotta tell me I'm hella great\nI don't speak on it nowadays, I just meditate\nY'all can have the bars, nigga, I spit hard metal gates\nHenry Louis Gates when I cop me some new estate\nMake room for myself, I'm in a way different mental place\nI keep it real, all y'all look anime\nI'm fine like Anna Mae, black don't crack like Angela\nBlack and brave like in the A, it don't come with apologies\n'Less it's Tip and some Andre, when you greet me it's, \"Namaste\"\nSpread love the Brooklyn way or like marmalade\nNo matter if you street street or more like the promenade\nWe gotta come together like the corn and the dookie braids\nFor the present and future days, I say what I gotta say\nI am Nina and Roberta, the one you love but ain't heard of\nGot my middle finger up like Pac after attempted murder\nFailed to kill me, it's still me, woke up singing Shirley Murdock\nAs we lay these edges down, brown women, we so perfect\nWent from field nigga to still nigga, being cropped out the picture\nBut we all know who got the juice, my sisters\nImitating us in all the Hollywood pictures\nAnd still, they'll never be us, nigga (Nigga)\nI'm from the back woods where Nina would\nSing about the life we should lead\nA new dawn, another deed, I try to do some good\nI felt more damned than Mississippi was\nThey deny Nina in Philadelphia\nAnd still we persevere like all the 400 years of our own blood, Africa\nOld panthers lookin' back like who gon' come up after us?\nOutside the movies, I make sure before it move you\nIt moved me, now bow down to a queen, please\nSurvival\n\n\nHere's to the honey in you\nTo the bittersweet in me\nI will shed this blood so romantically, so viciously quiet\nHere's to a moment of silence\nI've poured and poured my soul again, here's to epiphanies\nThere was never a we\nThere was you all and there was me\nIn this war, likely to succeed\nUnlike me to surrender\nTrying and dying to breathe poetry to rise in the light of day\nTo subconsciously exist cautiously ascending towards freedom\nPraying for a breather\nDo you see my pain?\nDo I seem like prey?\nEmpathy be the reason you're still standing\nWe are not the same\nI've lived more lives than you, I have less pride than you\nI'm extraterrestrial, I was created different\nI've been here many times before and I've never been defeated, and still\nI will never be defeated (Defeated)"

        "\n\n\nBack when I first grabbed that pen\nI told myself I was gon' win\nAnd I ain't know when\nBut it was gon' end up happenin', I want in\nSo you can take your top 5 list\nDead or alive, and put me after Em\nI'm a fuckin' genius\nGrippin' my fuckin' penis, livin' this life\nYou can't tell me nothin'\nStill ain't really got no money, fuckin' right\nI'm all about that real, about that real\nThis ain't no motion picture\nI tell you how that feel, how that feel\nEven when the odds against you\nThey wanna see me wearin' Polo drawers\nPut two chains on, and that ain't wrong\nBut that ain't me, I go too damn hard\nI don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out\nBlack lip nigga with his hair wild, too damn proud\nBeen killin' this since Cam made \"Oh Boy\"\nOh boy, I'm the man now\nTDE, put the money in my hand, ain't shit free\nThis business is quick sand and I won't sink\nPut the pistol in my hand and I won't think\nBlat, blat, blat! Rest in peace\nYou just made room for the next to be\nI never been afraid to say what I wanna say\nWhen I wanna say it, okay then\nFurthermore, we do this for y'all\nRap is stressin', but it pays great\nThat is, until you lose appeal\nAnd your release date get date raped\nStay safe, hold your head\nI got two fish and a loaf of bread\nFeed the people food for thought\n\u2018Cause we all equal, who'd have thought?\n\n\nThey wanna share my light, they wanna share my light\nThey wanna share my light, they wanna share my light\nThey wanna share my light, they wanna share my light\nThey wanna share my light, they wanna share my light\nYou can have all my shine, I'll give you the light\nYou can have all my shine, I'll give you the light\n\n\nI used to wanna rap like Jay Z\nNow I feel I could run laps 'round Jay Z\nNas ain't seen nothin' this nasty\nBIG and Pac got it comin' when I pass, too\nYou got the mic? I ain't the one you wanna pass to\nMy niggas say my new shit past due\nI paid dues, even got that shit tattooed\nHiiiPower on another plateau\nI know you know we need a few plaques too\nThe brand new niggas with a attitude\nPoppin' in Compton or Timbuktu\nI might even sell my new shit for ten bucks too\nToo ill when I jot these words, true eel when I shock the world\nI know life's a bitch\nWhen you know life's a bitch, then that's not your girl\nCold shit, I'm hot though, like coal get, Ab-Soul\nThis is a shift in paradigm\nI remember when I couldn't spare a dime\nNow I step in with a pair of dimes, on P's, y'all know me\nFlow like water, admiralty, the best author ever to breathe\nAnd as we proceed to follow these dreams, I ain't losin' no sleep\nNo-no on them NoDoz, just know \"no\" if it's no dough\nSo high, but I'm Soulo, two cups and I sip slow\nTakin' my time, we don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show\nNow let's go!\n\n\nThey wanna share my light, they wanna share my light\nThey wanna share my light, they wanna share my light\nThey wanna share my light, they wanna share my light\nThey wanna share my light, they wanna share my light\nYou can have all my shine, I'll give you the light\nYou can have all my shine, I'll give you the light\n\n\nTime and time, I drop line for line but only time will tell\nIf I ever go Columbine and cop thirty 9s and cock back and kill\nSee, the truth is they wanna know\nHow close me, Dre, and Snoop is\nOr how the shoe fits when they choose this\nTo beat 2Pac, but truth, I give two shits\n'Bout expectations or critics hatin'\nShit, I just put Moms on vacation\nBitch, you never know my new location, it's across nations\nCourt cases get thrown out\nSo tell the mothafuckin' king dethrone now\nI am ruler, I am highness, the Prince Zamunda\nI am the shit like what the prune does\nBlack on black tint like Kinte Kunta\nBlack is back, bitch, I'm kin to Kunta\nBlack-on-black crime resent the shooter\nBlat, blat, blat! I intend to mute ya\nRacks on racks, I don't rap on tracks\nWithout my A-game, so please don't ask me about no pressure\nBitch, with the grip of my fingertip I can hold this coast together\n\n\nThey wanna share my light, they wanna share my light\nThey wanna share my light, they wanna share my light\nThey wanna share my light, they wanna share my light\nThey wanna share my light, they wanna share my light\nYou can have all my shine, I'll give you the light\nYou can have all my shine, I'll give you the light"

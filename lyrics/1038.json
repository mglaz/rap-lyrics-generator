        "\nSave all the drama\nCause here comes the Big Mama\nAny bitch who rip Shant\u00e9, I bomb her\nCause y'all weak-ass hoes got me fed up\nSo hookers, get your gloves, and yo, let's go head up\nWall to wall y'all, all will fall\nI don't stall cause in this brawl, it's winner takes all\nA title bout for all the clout\nAny hooker trying to step to this, it's lights out\nOne hit, your head split, throat slit\nThink you're Miss It, but I started this shit\nAt 14 years old I was going gold\nWhile I was on tour, you was touring the ho stroll\nSucking dicks and turning tricks to get a quick fix\nWhile I was putting dope hits in the mix\nRipping shows with Kane and Biz Markie\nFucking up Roxanne and taking out Sparky\nNiggas came in flocks from blocks and blocks\nTo watch the Rox knock bitches out the box\nAnd every place I played, I headlined\nStrictly big names on the topic read mine\nThe q-u-double e-n\nQueen of emceeing\nWhenever I flow it's poetry in\nMotion, so you can save all the drama\nAnd get the fuck out the way, here comes the Big Mama\n\n\n(Mama - mama - Aww!)\n(I gave birth to most of them MC's)\n\n\nRhymes are deadly, so hooker, write out your will\nHere comes the queen foot-first to your grill\nReciting poems that hit like boulders\nSmacking your head dead off your motherfucking shoulders\nSo nip all the talk in the bud\nThis ain't no game, boy, I came to draw blood\nAt any hag thinking that she could last with me\nIt only takes one blast, and that ass'll be\nWrecked, ruined, damaged, ripped\nCross my path, your ass'll get whipped\nCause Shant\u00e9 ain't about no games\nMatter of fact, yo, I'mma start calling off names\nFirst up is Latifah\nYou roll up, and I'mma smoke that ass like reefer\nCause you ain't never in life been a star to me\nSold the fuck out trying to go R&B\nNow that shit is shady\nYou say ladies first, well I'm the first lady\nAnd all y'all hoes are phony\nTry to get flipped, I'mma rip you and your girl Monie\nYou're illegitimate, tryin to get a little bit\nAnd I'm about sick of that 'Monie-in-the-middle'-shit\nYour album cold garbage\nHad one good jam, now you think you a star, bitch\nBreaking your neck trying to be in the limelight\nBut give you a mic, and you can't even rhyme right\nSo get the fuck off the scene\nCause I got a M-16 that says 'Shant\u00e9's the queen'\nAnd all you bitches got your style from me\nThe capital S-h-a-n-t-\u00e9\nUsed to go to my show, analyze how the sound flow\nOn the down low, fuck around, lay around, ho\nSo save all the drama\nAnd make room for the Big Mama\n\n\n\n\nThe real queen's in effect\nWhenever I come, yo, I come correct\nAnd niggas give me the utmost due respect\nAnd any hag that try to last\n'll cold get smoked like marijuana cause her ass is grass\nI dig ditches for you bitches\nWhile I collect riches and give you a head full of stitches\nCause in a beef I don't sleep or lollygag\nSending you hags offstage in a bodybag\nCause Shant\u00e9 is a rebel\nYou say you're \"Lyte as a Rock,\" you get crushed like a pebble\nOne word, and I'mma bag her\nWatch the bitch stagger, cause I don't dig the bulldagger\nTo me a butch don't deserve a mic in hand\nSomebody tell her to stop acting like a man\nShe needs something real thick to help her out quick\n(What?) And that's a good piece of dick\nNow as for that West Coast slut\nWith fake-ass hair, contacts, and a padded butt\nInstead of \"stompin to tha 90s\", use your brain\nAnd stomp your ass down to Jack LaLane\nYou better hurry and hop on a diet plan\nAnd keep the pork chops out the frying pan\nYeah, I said it, so what?\nYou roll up, slut, you get a fucking gun buck to your gut\nI'm bringing tears to all my peers\nI ain't new, I been doin this shit for ten years\nBring any ho, and I'll wreck her\nI rip the nicest, from Isis down to Salt-N-Pepa\nAnd now you know that I'm the star of the show, ho\nWhile I get dough, you're giving up the yo-yo\nYou say a nigga can't play with it\nYou got another job? Well bitch, you better stay with it\nCause you ain't shit in this here\nShant\u00e9's the queen, and I'm making it clear\nKicking flavors the way it's supposed to be\nThat's why no other emcees coming close to me\nI leave em all in the dust\nFrom crumbs to crust\nIt's a must that all opponents get bust\nSo get the fuck off the stage and save all the drama\nAnd make room for the Big Mama\n\n"

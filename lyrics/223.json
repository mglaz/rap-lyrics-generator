        "\nYeah, you remember back in the days\nWhen niggas used to rock waves and shit?\nWhen like, yo, I had the fucking 360s, my nigga\nLike nobody in the hood was fucking with my shit\nAnd that's real shit\n\n\nUhh, since '9-5, momma been working nine-five\nAnd I know the landlord fed up with our lies\nSo we pray to the Gods, the Jahs and the Allahs\nTo keep us safe and watch our lives\nCause all we tryna do is do good\nPut on my hood when I walk through hoods\nCause these niggas these days is loco\nYou'll get it in ya vocals if you ain't a local\nYeah, that's why I'm tryna go global\nYeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul\nAnd I\u2019m hopeful that me spittin it soulful\nWill have me in the Daily Postal, flying coastal, eatin tofu\nLike I told you, I know niggas who trash rappin\nWorried bout the trendin fashions rather than ascendin' passion\nThey want me send em tracks but I just send em laughter\nRight after I start laughin, they start askin \"What happened?\"\nBut back to the chapter\nMomma told me follow dreams, should never have to ask her, to\nSo that\u2019s what I do, became an MC master\nSince then it\u2019s been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper\nGo ahead ask em, \"Who's Joey Bad?\"\nWatch em gasp, asthma, damn it\u2019s so sad\nHe paused the chatter cause he know he rather back up\nThan to admit the kid is hotter than magma\nBut fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due\nCause you ain't gon' like the karma when it's set up on you\nIt can get you on your medical, fuck you up in the decimals\nOr get you 2 to 3 for residue found in your retinal\nUh, and they told me not to be so complex\nDumb it down to accomplish articles in Complex\nAnd The Source, alfredo of course\nThere I go again, steppin out of line, runnin' off course\nI heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse\nWith your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk\nFor it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the north\nSpeaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults\nI'm sure by now you can assume he never lost\nUnless with some form of divorce, or a corpse\nBorn boss, no days off, child labor\nLet me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes\nYeah\n\n\nWhat the rap audience ain't ready for is a real person\nYou know what I wanna say: a real N-I-G-G-A\nI'm coming at 'em 100% real, I ain't compromising nothin'\nAnybody that talk about me got problems, you know what I'm sayin'\nIt's gonna be straight-up, like if I was a street person\nThat's how I'm comin' at the whole world\nAnd I'm being real about it and I'ma grow with my music\n\n\nYeah, but it's far from over\nWon't stop 'til I meet Hova and my momma's in a Rover\n'Til I'm an owner of the world's finest motors\nI blow like supernovas in your daughter's room on a poster\nKnown as history's biggest musical composer\nNo disrespect to Bob Mar, but yeah, another stoner\nMarijuana my odor, and when I get older\nHope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum\nLike three times, have three kids, I hope\nMe & wife can show em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did\nI hope they acknowledge the knowledge\nCause yeah, they gon need it\nCause when my parents tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it\nCouldn't believe it, 'til I saw with my own pupils\nFelt bad when I learned that their advice was truly useful\nBut fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual\nEven though over time, my punishments, they grew more crucial\nShould use the word brutal, cause my parents mad strict\nHope one day I'll attract the likes of even Madlib\nGo gold on mad shit and hear my songs mastered\nUntil then, all I can do is imagine\nImagine, I'ma make it all happen"

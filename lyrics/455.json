        "\nIf Michael Jackson came alive right now\nHe'd ask you to smoke one for him\nSo in his honor\n\n\nYou niggas Spud Webb, coming up short\nThink you're Dee Brown, jump if you want\nI put it on my momma and her very last nerve\nRicky Madoff everything I deserve\nThe square root of a kilo is me nigga\nThe square root of a kilo is me nigga\nDo the math, I'm a motherfucking G nigga\n\n\nIt's all on me now, as you can see now\nI'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied\nBeen shittin' on you fucks a long time, time to pee now\nWhen you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now\nI'm at the round table, where your seat at?\nWhere your plate, where your lobster, where your sea bass?\nWe ain't never left, acting like we back\nYou should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap\nThis the circle that'll murk you, blackout, short circuit\nSomebody show them square ass niggas the first exit\nThis here reserved for soldiers most definitely\nSo watch what you say and where you step more carefully\nIf I fall in the field and ain't no more air for me\nPour some on the ground and put one in the air for me\nTell my enemies fuck 'em, they know already but fuck 'em\nTell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle\nYou don't know nann nigga, nope, uh uh\nThis famous that'll still throw copper\nCross so heavy crack the tabernacle\nFire the ganja back up\nThrow some blow in my tobacco\nThen crank the Lac up\nOne match left, this the last turn\nSanteria candles in my sanctuary burn\nI'mma earn 'til the last court adjourn\n'Til the last gavel drop we gon' have it locked\nWe gon' have it locked\nWe gon' have it locked\n\n\nI'm part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto\nBut niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company\nIt's funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably\nBut when I was broke and sleeping on floors they ain't want nothing from me\nMy future's so bright but my past so ugly\nAnd I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me\nTried to section off the past but it still haunts me\nSo I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair\nAll this space created, all that hard work it got me here\nSo what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldn't be here\nPower to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear\nAnd I'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair\nWarring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there\nOut in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air\nSecluded in my thoughts in fear\nNo one to talk to, no one there\nNot even a voice, not even an ear\nNo one alive, no one to care\nNow I got a power circle, now I'm on a power trip\nAnd they calling me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit\nStone me, throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it\nIt's funny how it comes full circle\nNow they wanna be a part of the power circle\nThey wanna be a part of the power circle\n\n\nMay the wind be at your back\nMay the bad be in your past\nMay the kids take all your good\nAnd your wife have class\nAnd you realize your goals\nAnd what's life without grind\nThose niggas, yo' niggas?\nHope those niggas real as mine\nMay the wind be at your back\nMay the bad be in your past\nMay the kids take all your good\nAnd your wife have class\nAnd you realize your goals\nAnd what's life without grind\nThose niggas, yo' niggas?\nHope those niggas real as mine\n\n\nThere's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it\nOnce you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred\nThere's no applause for ya and success is hard for ya\nThere's enemies, envy, with green my niggas -- lawnmower\nAnd I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford\nAnd I ain't thugging, they clapping at me, a encore\nGot a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy\nI give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety\nShit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining\nAnd my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza\nJealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy I made it\nI be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation\nAllah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers\nI seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers\nSo shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians\nMy circle small but regardless, my circumference official\nMy clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage\nThey gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us\nI'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it\nGuess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music\nCash rule the world -- at least it do with girls\nAt least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts\nIf they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it\nAnd we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle\nWe don't deal with weak squares in this power circle\n\n\nI'm like welcome to the power circle\nI came a long way, I started with a powdered circle\nClique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you\nCause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal\nLotta talking, lotta Tweeting, 'til you hear that chopper speaking\nKill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, I'd believe it\nIf you see it then you got it, nigga never give up\nCause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up\nMy cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up\nCause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup\nAnd still make the profit\nThe streets say I'm the hottest and a nigga still modest\nI'm just being honest\nBack to the wall, never let 'em get behind us\nMac in my draws fitting right in my designers\nLook at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered\nAnd there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas\nPut the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster\nAnd the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia\nJust talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin' bout?\nProbably talkin' bout us, we the only thing to talk about\nCause we the only thing to talk about\nCause we the only thing to talk about\n\n\nLook inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived\nYou won't last a weekend outside\nSeen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise\nLater on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried\nSee a demon don't compromise\nAnd so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone\nI'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons\nI might as well put all my killers in YSL\nPut my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell\nHell's fire, I never lie, you will never grind\nI know the priors they running by us when we do crime\nI know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms\nWhen they heard that Ohio State gave me 30 racks in July\nOh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life\nWhen they day breaks and you earned them stripes\nAnd you learned that strike\nFrom upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life\nIt's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write\nNow your fate can record it denied a reporter replied\nThe death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm\nOn a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns\nSo about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind\nNow one fake, I'm a realist in strive, I'm a billion in five\nWell a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine\nAnd I recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine\nBut pussy, we'll hurt you\nLife in the power circle\n\n\nRegardless of how it goes down\nLife goes on, am I right?\nTried to warn you niggas\nI tried to warn you niggas\nIt's too late now\nDouble M-G\nToo much cake\nToo much power\nToo much respect\nBow down, nigga\nUgh!"

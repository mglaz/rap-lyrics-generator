        "\nRight on my tongue, look\nYo, check, my flow is unknown to man yet\nDammit, keep running around like an annual banquet\nMade a withdrawal with your broad, she left the bank wet\nRub her like a condom contemplating dangerous sex\nI'm unimpressed with your talent, skill still appeal\nA maestro on the mic though, I'm almost ill as Camille for real\nAin't never runnin' from nothin', I'm fit to tread mills\nName another movement makin' time stand still\nHiiipower to the third degree\nMurder, we emerged and it was an emergency\nIt's closed curtains for you worthless earthlings\nHurtin' cause I rise like mercury in the burning heat\nWord on the street Soulo done done it again\nLook at me, I used to match a dub sack with my friends\nNow we smokin' by the O, like the letters P and N\nAin't have to start watching CNN for you to see an end\nIt's coming quicker than you think, don't mean to rub it in\nLike lubriderm, but you should learn that you could never fuck with him\nAb's gettin' bigger, but I ain't do no sit-ups\nGot the hiccups cause I keep puffin' Ports without the filter\nFeel the vibe switch in every single room that I enter\nTold my bitch to make room for a tomb for her placenta, nigga\nI fuck her 'til she have a seizure in my leisure time\nShe know I love her, also know I don't need her\nCause I'm a king and I smoke a lot of weed\nThat makes sense, it's about 33 ounces in a liter\nIn layman's terms you lames had better pay respect\nOr you'll be sleepin', they'll be at your wake payin' their respects\n\n\nSaid it's the soul cold wickedness\nOld folk killin' shit\nMost dope syndicate, the GoPros filmin' it\nGood coke sniffin' shit, broke no benefits\nSmack him in his face and then I'm blowin' smoke into it\nObliterated on a big estate\nShit, I figure fame is just a bitches game\nThat's why there's raindrops drippin' off my windowpane\nAnd I was gettin' money far before the Fisker came\nOfficial name's got plugs like a new strain does\nYou may be hot inside your city, homie you ain't us\nYou can't trust nothin' if it's comin' with a dollar sign\nIt's genius comin' from out of my awkward mind\nCross the line, it's just not the time\nAnd he ain't thinkin', put that red dot on his mind\nI'm Santana's bandana, against me you don't stand a chance\nCall you fancy pants cause when you're drunk you do the hammer dance\nIf there's a random chance you're fuckin' up my Phantom plans\nI'mma go bananas and blam 'em into the ambulance\nMy mother's sonogram was like a mission statement\nCause I wasn't patient, left that pussy in a spaceship\nY'all fools basic, your parents both racist\nI'm lawyering these hoes out here, beatin' cases\nShe eatin' dick so she plead the fifth\nYeah, it's Larry Fish, homie he's a myth\nYou sunk my battleship, I'll be in Nazareth by where Jesus live\nAnd your homie with you, he's a bitch, some vagina shit\nGettin' faded, go and sin in Vegas\nI'm just observant, man of different faces\nSome dick-licker want my kids in her\nShe a switch-hitter, told her bring her bitch with her\nThe dick split her like a swisher then I'm outty, outty\nNever eat the pussy if it's lousy, it's lousy\nI'm the prodigal son\nWith ominous, Nostradamus anonymous visions\nConfidence, some Obama shit, in Mocassins they can\nIn moccasins they can ante, alright"

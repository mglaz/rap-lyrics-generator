        "\nI don't belong to you\nKeep it on the down low\nKeep it on the down low\nI don't belong to you\nKeep it on the down low\nKeep it on the down low\nI don't belong to you\n\n\nAin't no white house, ain't no picket fence\nBaby, you know we don't want the same things\nWhile you're caught up in your feelings\nI feel the same as I did yesterday\nBaby, we've been through this and I feel the same way\nI know you don't wanna hear this, and I hate to say it, babe\n\n\nI done told you, I done showed you\nNow you wanna act like I tricked you\nBut I'm sleep, can't you see?\nThere's a difference between me, you and these sheets\n\n\nI don't belong to you\nKeep it on the down low\nKeep it on the down low\nI don't belong to you\nKeep it on the down low\nKeep it on the down low\nI don't belong to you\n\n\nAin't no white house, ain't no picket fence\nBaby, you know we don't want the same things\nWhile you're caught up in your feelings\nI feel the same as I did yesterday\nBaby, we've been through this and I feel the same way\nI know you don't wanna hear this, and I hate to say it, babe\n\n\nDon't you act innocent, you own the part that you play\nAnd I'm not interested in playing your childish games\nNo, no, no, no, I don't have to keep it real\nBut I do because I care 'bout how you feel\n\n\nI don't belong to you\nKeep it on the down low\nKeep it on the down low\nI don't belong to you\nKeep it on the down low\nKeep it on the down low\nI don't belong to you\n\n\nAin't no white house, ain't no picket fence\nBaby, you know we don't want the same things\nWhile you're caught up in your feelings\nI feel the same as I did yesterday\nBaby, we've been through this and I feel the same way\nI know you don't wanna hear this, and I hate to say it, babe\n\n\nDon't take it all so personal\nI just can't give you what you want\nDon't think that you can just keep tryin' me\nBoy, I'll just leave you alone\nI don't belong to you"
